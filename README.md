# Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive
This repository will house all code, data, and files related to my work in the Springboard Data Science Immersive program

# Capstone 1
----------------------
## [Facilitation of Cryptocurrency Price Prediction by Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/Capstone%201%20Project)
**Key Skills**
* Web Scraping
* NLP - Natural Language Processing
* Time Series Analysis
* Deep Neural Networks

**Custom Sentiment Analysis Library Created to facilitate in Overall Sentiment Analysis on Cryptocurrency News Articles scraped form the web. Used in conjunction with historical price data, the analysis is used in a deep neural network in order to predict future pricing for a crypto coin of interest**

# Capstone 2
-----------------------
## [Exploring Computational Efficiency in Object Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/Capstone%202%20Project)
**Key Skills**
* Image Processing
* Video Processing
* H5 Storage
* Object Oriented Programming
* Tensorflow
* Tensorboard
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Object Detection

**Exploring different image preprocessing techniques and methods in order to speed up CNN training. As a positive side effect, the transformation of original full scale data results in a smaller memory expense, both hard drive and RAM.**

# Clustering Methods
------------------------
## [K-Nearest Neighbors and PCA](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/CLUSTERING)
**Key Skills**
* K-Means
* PCA - Principle Component Analysis
* Elbow Sum of Squares Method

Mini project on customer segmentation and being able to identify different types of customers and then figure out ways to find more of those individuals so you can get more customers! The data comes from John Foreman's book Data Smart. The dataset contains both information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent) and transaction level data from customers (which offer customers responded to and what they bought).

# Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA)
--------------------------------
## [Hospital Readmittance Data](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/EDA_hospital_readmit)
## [Human Temperature Data](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/EDA_human_temperature)
## [Racial Discrimination Data](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/EDA_racial_discrimination)
**Key Skills**
* Central Limit Theorem
* Statistical Analysis
* Data Visualization
* z-test
* t-test
* Margin of Error (MOE)
* Chi-Squared Test
* Bootstrap Statistics

Several EDA's performed on varying data categories. Hospital Readmittance performs a statistical analysis on a previously done analysis to critique its validity. Human Temperature EDA uses bootstrap statistics to determine the true average temperature of the human body in both male and females. Racial Discrimination performs a statistical analysis on if race has a meaningful impact on the callback rate of candidates who have submitted resumes to jobs of interest.

# Machine Learning Algorithms
## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/linear_regression)
## [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/logistic_regression)
## [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Mooseburger1/Springboard-Data-Science-Immersive/tree/master/naive_bayes)
**Key Skills**
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Regression
* Naive Bayes

Performing several Machine Learning Algorithms in miniprojects such as: Labeling an obersvation as either male or female based on height and weight data (Logistic Regression), Regression Price Estimate on Boston Housing data using Linear Regression, and predicting movie reviews with Naive Bayes Models
