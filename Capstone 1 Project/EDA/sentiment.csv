(Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images) Ripple solidifies #3 cryptocurrency spot with a $35.7B market cap.   After a general trend of consolidation in the worldwide cryptocurrency market—following drops in the Dow Jones industrial average, Facebook banning cryptocurrency advertising, news of Chinese and South Korean regulation, India pushing toward a crackdown and news of Tether and Bitfinex subpoenas—the market cap is beginning to inch back up after January's lows. One coin in particular made big leaps overnight (PST): Ripple (XRP). Disclosure: I own some Ripple.  According to CoinMarketCap, Ripple was trading for $0.771540 USD at 9:19pm PST Feb. 8. By 6:44am on Feb. 9, that number was $0.931411—a jump of 21 percent in just 10 hours. 
 Ripple 24-hour trading chart The price is currently $0.916888, 21 percent higher than it was a day ago. This performance is 2-4x higher than other major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Cardano.Continued from page 1 After exhibiting unprecedented growth in December 2017, Ripple then became the worst-performing major coin of January, performing at -49.56 percent. The recent surge follows announcements of partnerships with IDT, Mercury FX, MoneyGram and Santander as well as an ""open payments corridor"" to China via LianLian Yintong Electronic Payment Company. Furthering its position in Asia, SBI announced the creation SBI Virtual Currencies on Jan. 30, an exchange that will help Asian markets bridge the gap from fiat to crypto. Ripple still has a long way to go to reclaim its #2 spot on the cryptocurrency market, as Ethereum is holding strong with $83.3B—more than double Ripple's current market cap.

 Matthew Mellon Individual Investor Crypto Net Worth: $900 million-$1 billion* Matthew Mellon This heir to one of America's great banking fortunes, and a former chair of the New York Republican Party's finance committee, has struggled with drug addiction. So when he began dabbling heavily in cryptocurrencies years ago, his friends and family tried to dissuade him, figuring it was another erratic obsession. And, indeed, he abandoned some early investments and sold his Bitcoin a few years ago. 
 But then Mellon got turned on to XRP, spending some $2 million to acquire coins, which he liked because it's one of the few cryptocurrencies that are working within the banking system. ""Crypto is scary and dark. It's anti-America,"" says Mellon, 54. ""I am pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank. That's why I went with Ripple."" Mellon's XRP is worth around $1 billion. Recently divorced, he parties in a posh Los Angeles house he rents for $150,000 month. ""It's $1 billion virtually for free. I actually have earned it because I was the only person who was willing to raise his hand,"" says Mellon.

3,2018-01-02 08:00:00,Ripple,forbes,Meet The Crypto Billionaires Getting Rich From Ripple's XRP,"The value of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 to more than $600 billion, minting scores of crypto millionaires.  A few lucky holders are also breathing the rarefied air of the billionaires club — and not just in the most valuable cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which has a market capitalization of $237 billion. Two billionaires who now easily rank among the wealthiest Americans include the current and former CEOs of Ripple, a San Francisco-based company using blockchain technology in international financial transactions. It issues a token called XRP that, as of Monday, January 1, had a market capitalization of $88.9 billion; each XRP was trading at $2.39, according to Coinmarketcap. Just the week before, Ripple had surpassed Ethereum to become the second-most-valuable crypto asset. Cofounder and former CEO Chris Larsen, who stepped down in November 2016 and now serves as executive chairman of Ripple, has 5.19 billion XRP in his personal holdings and a 17% stake in the company, according to sources at Ripple. That gives him a net worth of $37.3 billion, using Monday’s exchange rate. 
 Chris Larsen, Ripple cofounder, executive chairman and former CEO That would make him the 15th richest American on the 2017 Forbes 400 list as of Monday, tying him with Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO and current owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers. He ranks a bit ahead of Abigail Johnson, the CEO of Fidelity, who is herself a big cryptocurrency fan, plus  hedge funder Ray Dalio and investor Carl Icahn, both of whom have made headlines for calling Bitcoin a bubble.  Current Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse owns a 6.3% stake in Ripple, according to a source at the company, and owns additional XRP tokens. He has a net worth of at least $9.5 billion. That would land him at around 54 on the list, with the addition of Larsen, just two slots below Charles Schwab. Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive officer of Ripple XRP skyrocketed in 2017 from $0.006 on January 1 to $2.30 on December 31 — a return of 38,000%.  A third person who’s gotten rich on XRP is Ripple cofounder Jed McCaleb, who left the company in 2013 and later came to an agreement with Ripple over the XRP he owns. McCaleb said he donated 2 billion XRP to a donor-advised fund. The remaining 5.3 billion XRP as of February 2016 are in a custody account at Ripple and are meted out to him on a monthly basis. Since the agreement was reached, he has been allowed to sell less than 1% of average daily volume on one exchange that now itself accounts for only 1%-2% of all XRP trading volume. If McCaleb had access to all of the XRP at once, he would be a billionaire.  (Additionally, McCaleb, who founded Mt. Gox in 2010, says he has no Bitcoins left, having sold them to found Ripple. Since leaving Ripple, he has since gone on to found Stellar, but his one billion Lumens, each valued at 48 cents, do not make him a billionaire and won’t vest for a couple years.) Ripple says it has more than 100 customers, such as American Express and Santander, who are collaborating on U.S-to-U.K. payments using Ripple technology.  XRP, being issued by a company, is less decentralized than many other cryptocurrencies. For instance, Ripple itself holds 61.3 billion XRP, including 55 billion that it keeps in escrow. Only 38.7 billion XRP tokens have been distributed. In contrast, Bitcoin is much less concentrated, though many early holders have a large number of coins. Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, is believed to own the largest amount, with estimated holdings of 980,000 Bitcoins ($13.4 billion by Monday's Bitcoin price). That represents only 5.8% of all Bitcoins currently in existence. One thing is very clear: the huge swings in the value of Ripple, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mean that there is no guarantee that any of these folks will still be billionaires when Forbes publishes its next list in March.

4,2018-01-14 11:46:00,Ripple,forbes,3 Reasons To Not Get Excited About Seagate's Investment In Ripple/XRP,"In May 2015, Seagate made an investment in Ripple Labs, which created the XRP cryptocurrency. Many tech companies make strategic investments so that they can gain access to technologies, which they believe could be useful for their business or in areas they want to explore. At the time one Ripple or XRP was worth less than a penny vs. the $1.83 it is currently trading.   A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency Bitcoin. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) On Monday morning this past week, a Seeking Alpha article postulated that Seagate’s investment in Ripple could be worth close to $8 billion or half of the company’s market cap. When the stock opened for trading, it spiked up from the previous Friday’s close of $42.94 to $49.70, up 19%. It fell back during the day but still closed up 7% at $46.00. After the market closed on Monday, Seagate positively preannounced its December quarter results. However, it appears that investors were expecting strong results as the stock was up less than 1% on Tuesday and closed at $46.39. For the week, it did increase over $8 or 19%. While the positive pre-announcement and the stock market strength probably contributed to the rise, it appears the Seeking Alpha article also helped. 
 Investment is worth about $1 billion (at current pricing) In reading through three analysts reports, it appears that Seagate’s investment in Ripple is significantly less than what was calculated in the Seeking Alpha article. RBC’s Seagate analyst Amit Daryanani talked with the company’s management and based on their discussion he believes it owns a 2%-3% stake in Ripple through its participation in the Series A and B rounds in 2015 and 2016. Ripple in turn owns about 60% of the actual XRP tokens. At the current market cap of $71 billion (XRP tokens are currently at $1.83), a 2.5% ownership of Ripple Labs, which controls 60% of the tokens, is worth just over $1 billion. This in turn is about 7% of Seagate’s market cap.  Cryptocurrencies are very volatile Three months ago, Ripple’s XRP price was $0.26, which translated to a $10 billion market cap. On Monday, its price ranged from $1.93 to $2.78 per Yahoo! Finance, which means its market cap had about a $33 BILLION market cap swing in 1 DAY.Continued from page 1 If Ripple was to unload a large percentage of its XRP holdings, it would almost assuredly crash the value of the tokens which would decrease the value of Seagate’s investment. Don’t count your chickens before they hatch Seagate’s investment is in Ripple Labs, which owns about 60% of the XRP token. This isn’t the same as owning a lot of cryptocurrency that can be liquidated. This could be a very nice windfall for Seagate but unless Ripple Labs sells the tokens and distributes the cash, it could be hard for Seagate to monetize this investment. This then means the investment’s value should be discounted to less than $1 billion.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token fell more than 30% in the space of a week, pushing lower as sentiment-driven trading fueled a sell-off in the digital token. XRP fell to as little as $1.18 earlier today, CoinMarketCap figures show. At this price, the digital token was down roughly 30.6% from the price of $1.70 it hit last Friday and approximately 69% below the all-time high of $3.84 reached earlier this month, additional CoinMarketCap data reveals. The digital token had recovered somewhat at the time of report, trading at $1.25.   
 A 'Tell Tale Sign' While Ripple announced new partnerships on Wednesday, January 24, markets did not react, meaning that the positive news did not provoke any significant change in price. Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments, described this as a ""tell tale sign of sentimental trading.""  ""Any other coin would have surged on the news of Partnerships,"" he emphasized, adding that ""XRP is making international payments and foreign exchange transactions easy and at a discount on its XRapid platform.""  Widespread Speculation Marouane Garcon, managing director of Amulet, a crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform that focuses on customer success and usability, commented on all the speculation surrounding XRP. ""Investors were accumulating at the lower levels in anticipation of another run,"" said Garcon.  ""There are still a lot of quasi believers in XRP and this price fluctuation is a prime example of that,"" he added. Iqbal Gandham, U.K. managing director for eToro, offered a similar point of view. ""It's purely a general market sentiment combined with a knowledge that ripple was much higher a few weeks ago and looks cheap,"" he said. ""Money comes in, but when a good bull run does not occur people panic on bad general news."" Ripple's Bright Future Regardless of what XRP does in the short-term, several analysts were optimistic about Ripple's future in the long-term. ""I still believe Ripple has a strong future among mainstream traders who take investment cues"" from major media outlets, said Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA.  ""Ripple continues to increase it platform use and that will add value to coin,"" stated Thorngren. ""With Ripple being the fastest and most cost efficient of the digital platforms it is no wonder why MoneyGram, IDT Corp and Mercury FX have aligned themselves here.""  As a result of all this, ""Serious Investors should take advantage of the prices here while they can,"" stated Thorngren.  Garcon, however, offered a different point of view, stating that many market observers are skeptical. ""People want adoption,"" he said. ""People want earth shattering news.   ""XRP will continue to float between $1-$2 until they deliver earth shaking news,"" stated Garcon.

6,2017-12-20 10:27:00,Ripple,forbes,The Bear Case For XRP: Bitcoin Futures Edition,"Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets at Ripple Labs Inc., speaks during the Consensus: Invest event in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017. Consensus: Invest, the world's first digital asset investor outlook event hosted by CoinDesk, brings institutional investors, hedge funds, money managers, banks, and family offices together to get connected with how to invest, store, trade and judge value in this new asset class. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg In August, the hedge I cofounded, Multicoin Capital, published an analysis of XRP, the native token of the Ripple network. We presented a bearish view of XRP tokens. A quick summary: Ripple, Inc. — the company that builds and maintains the Ripple network — has built a blockchain-based system that banks use to issue IOUs and settle debts. XRP has two uses: to pay fees on the Ripple network, and as a “bridge currency” for value transfers between any two institutions that don’t have a trusted relationship. However, its native token, XRP, is simply not necessary for the network to function. Since the Ripple network is permissioned as a direct result of its unique node list (UNL) system, the risk of rational actors spamming the network is low. It’s unlikely that JP Morgan would spam Bank of America, or that Hana Group of South Korea would spam Fidelity. Even if these institutions don’t trust one another, they still want to conduct business with one another. Spamming other banks just doesn’t make any sense. 
 The other intended use for XRP is to act as a “bridge currency:” If a scenario arises in which two financial institutions need to settle IOUs in local currencies, how does the debtor acquire the local currency of the creditor? Many currency pairs simply don’t exhibit substantial trading volume, for example, Kenyan dollars to South Korean won. Although most currency pairs are not substantial by volume relative to USD-Euro, the combination of long tails of currency pairs grows factorially, as a function of n!. Given that there are 180 fiat currencies around the world, there are about 16,000 currency pairs. Today, this problem is usually solved by using a market maker which provides liquidity in each currency to USD because USD is the global reserve currency. Ripple, Inc. proposes that financial institutions solve this problem using the Ripple network and XRP instead of the legacy banking infrastructure and USD. The Ripple network is superior as payment rail system relative to the legacy financial infrastructure. However, it just doesn’t make sense that rational financial institutions will voluntarily use XRP as a reserve currency to settle transactions because XRP will always be -- by definition -- less liquid than a global reserve such as Bitcoin. Regardless of the quality of the underlying technological infrastructure, the single most important attribute of a global reserve currency is liquidity. This is why USD reigns supreme: the largest economy in the world by definition has the largest amount of liquidity for most currency pairs. Given XRP’s continued meteoric rise over the last 3-4 months, we decided to revisit our original thesis. In the last month, we’ve spoken with blockchain leads at major international remittance companies, traditional asset management firms, commercial banks, and investment banks. The individuals we spoke with have all evaluated Ripple’s solution and XRP. All of them used the system in some capacity, and all of them independently came to the same conclusion: if their institution were to ever come to use the Ripple network to settle transactions -- which they deemed unlikely -- they would want to use the global reserve currency for settlements, and not XRP. The global reserve currency is far more likely to be BTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ether (ETH) because these are permissionless financial systems and experience significant native demand from consumers and businesses all over the world. It simply doesn’t make any sense that XRP -- as a permissioned currency that only banks can access in substantial quantities -- will ever have more liquidity than a global reserve that’s used by billions of people. The magnitude of the liquidity discrepancy between currency pairs is enormous. Over the last 30 days, the average daily volume for BTC was just shy of $10 billion, and for XRP was about $500 million. This gap is likely to grow as BTC becomes a global, censorship-resistant, store of value.Continued from page 1 Ripple Inc. is aware of this problem: they recently launched a liquidity program. Since Ripple Inc. owns about 2/3 of total XRP supply – with an implied valuation of $45-50 billion based on current spot prices – they are deliberately discounting their service at a significant rate to entice their customers to use XRP rather than BTC. This artificial liquidity is just - artificial. It will run out. This will maintain a floor of liquidity for XRP in the short term, but there’s just no way for this program to provide the liquidity necessary to exceed that of the global reserve. Unfortunately for XRP holders, the probability of XRP becoming the global reserve just became substantially more difficult. The CBOE and CME -- two of the world’s largest futures exchanges -- just launched Bitcoin futures trading. The magnitude of this development cannot be overstated. This hinders XRP’s chances of becoming the global reserve currency. For large financial institutions, the single largest problem with cryptocurrencies, other than perhaps custodianship, is price volatility. Futures can be used to hedge price risk. In the next few months, as these futures markets mature, banks will be able to buy and hold billions of dollars worth of BTC on their balance sheets while hedging out price risk. Given this, why would any rational financial institution want to use XRP as the bridge currency to settle transactions? BTC now has two huge advantages: ~20x the liquidity, and a futures market that allows banks to hedge price risk while holding large amounts of BTC. XRP bulls counter that XRP offers faster settlements times and lower fees than BTC. This is true, but irrelevant. The value of liquidity and ability to hedge price risk are far more important than these two relatively insignificant technology details. 
 So why does XRP keep pumping? The team is one of the best in crypto. The venture capital investors backing Ripple Inc. are top notch. They continue to announce new banking partners. I fully expect these banks to use Ripple’s software, and experiment with XRP. But... We maintain our position: in the long run, we’re bearish on XRP. We simply don’t see any series of events that can occur that would cause financial institutions to voluntarily adopt XRP over the global reserve. Having said that, given the state of crypto markets today, XRP could keep pumping. There’s really not a good objective valuation model for XRP given the intrinsic velocity problem that it faces, so it could 5x before our thesis is reflected in XRP price movements. “In the short term, the market is a voting machine; in the long term, it’s a weighing machine.” - Warren Buffett Update 12/21/2017 at 12:53 US Central Time: This article originally misstated the number of currency pairs globally.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token fell sharply today, extending its recent losses as cryptocurrencies suffered widespread declines. The XRP token fell to as little as $1.23, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price, it was down 33% in the last 24 hours and roughly 68% from its all-time high of $3.84, additional CoinMarketCap.  This took place as the broader digital currency market experienced a notable correction, falling below $600 billion for the first time since January 1.   When explaining this recent pullback, analysts singled out a handful of factors. 
 Natural Retracement Digital currencies have had a very strong run over the last few years. Since the start of 2017, their total market capitalization (market cap) has climbed more than 4,500%, rising from roughly $17.7 billion to more than $835 billion earlier this month according to CoinMarketCap. ""The recent decline in cryptos seems to be a simple retracement after the fantastic run we've been having,"" said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, provided similar input, stating that ""This is a natural price correction.""  Regulatory Uncertainty Analysts also singled out regulatory uncertainty as having an adverse effect on market sentiment and therefore helping fuel losses in cryptocurrencies. Many market observers are watching South Korea, which is currently contemplating a ban on digital currency trading, according to The Associated Press (AP). Earlier today, the nation's finance minister told a local radio station that shutting down all cryptocurrency exchanges was certainly an option, although any such action would require thorough review, AP reported. Hayes spoke to the regulatory uncertainty that surrounds digital currency activities in South Korea and other jurisdictions, stating that the resulting ""FUD"" is affecting profit taking. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of data provider CryptoCompare, provided similar input. ""South Korea is one bug bear to most cryptos positive momentum,"" he said.

A little over a week ago, Ripple made explosive gains, surging 84% in a day to become the #4 cryptocurrency by market cap. Disclosure: I own some XRP. In the days following, Ripple underwent another round of growth, jumping from the $0.50 range to $0.75. After that, disregarding minor fluctuations, the XRP market remained steady—even through Coinbase's announcement that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) buying, selling, and trading would be supported on the platform—which dropped the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and many other cryptocurrencies worldwide. 
 According to CoinMarketCap, at 2:24pm Dec. 20, XRP was trading at $0.75779. This morning at 7:04am (Dec. 21), the price was $1.24—marking growth of 64 percent in just 17 hours, and crossing the ""historic"" $1 milestone. The price is currently $1.11.   What you need to know about Ripple (XRP) Ripple operates as a payment network called RippleNet. The goal of the platform is to streamline the transfer of funds—to almost any other currency or cryptocurrency in the world in 4 seconds. Ripple works with banks and financial institutions such as AMEX and the Japan Bank Consortium to become the premier cryptocurrency of record, offering a quick, cost-effective way to transfer funds globally.Continued from page 1 This has huge implications for how we move money across borders.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token extended its losses today, dropping to less than $1.75. The digital currency fell to as little as $1.72, according to CoinMarketCap.  This recent low represented a 55% decline from the all-time high of $3.84 reached last week, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.   The digital asset suffered this pullback after experiencing an astronomical gain where it climbed more than 30,000% in 2017. XRP prices experienced further gains early this year, approaching $4 as the digital currency benefited from significant hype. 
 XRP Became ""Overvalued,"" Says Analyst The cryptocurrency's recent pullback took place because the digital asset was ""overvalued,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital. ""Its price initially spiked because sentiment was high; there were rumors of additional deals with big banks and its token, XRP, being listed on Coinbase,"" he said.  ""When those didn't materialize, sentiment turned, and investors started dumping after it hit $3,"" stated DiPasquale.  Chris Keshian, co-founder of the Apex Token Fund, a tokenized crypto fund-of-funds, offered similar sentiment.  ""XRP was trading at high prices due to the recent news announcements around Ripple's banking partnerships,"" but once the resulting hype began to fade, the cryptocurrency dropped sharply.  Cyclical Price Movements Digital currency trader Marius Rupsys described XRP's pullback differently, emphasizing that ""cryptocurrencies move in cycles,"" and stating that ""Ripple tends to increase in price to very high levels and then just go down for extended period of time.""  Rupsys pointed to a broader correction, stating that ""Not only Ripple but many other cryptocurrencies are going down for the past days.""  Iqbal Gandham, U.K. managing director at eToro, gave a similar point of view, stating that Ripple's recent price decline is ""all part of the general correction,"" stating that XRP is suffering a little more than other currencies because it climbed so sharply.  ""Projects that got high valuations, like Ripple (10x in a month) can't sustain this growth as it is not driven by fundamentals, but rather speculation,"" concluded Rupsys.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token extended its recent losses today, dropping below $1 as the broader crypto markets saw quite a bit of red. As a result of this downward movement, the XRP token fell to as little as $0.9093, a more than 75% decrease from the digital asset's all-time high, according to CoinMarketCap.   The digital token fell to this level during a day when the total value of the cryptocurrency markets fall to roughly $450.5 billion, a nearly 35% drop since the start of the day, additional CoinMarketCap figures show. Regulatory Uncertainty This sharp decline was largely attributed to regulatory uncertainty. 
 ""The market is correcting off the back of news that China is moving to crack down on cryptocurrency trading,"" said Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director for eToro.  ""Chinese investors are likely spooked having heard the news and the market is on edge as a result.""  Other analysts pointed to continued uncertainty in South Korea. While digital currencies in general suffered sharp declines, Ripple's XRP fell even more. Ripple's Speculation-Fueled Rise When explaining Ripple's underperformance, analysts emphasized that its recent run up was fueled largely by investors who were hoping the digital token would experience further gains. ""XRP has fallen so hard because much of its rise was based on speculation,"" said Marouane Garcon, managing director of Amulet, a crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform that focuses on customer success and usability. He added that: You couldn’t turn on your TV last week and not hear about XRP or its CEO. Then there was the huge buy orders in anticipation of it being listed on Coinbase. Once Coinbase said they weren't adding any new assets the pullback started. Now everyone is continuing to take profits. Milan Koch, managing partner at alphablock, a crypto-asset hedge fund focused on ICOs, offered similar sentiment, asserting that XRP was highly overvalued, and it has been plunging lately because its price was driven up so much by speculation.  ""In general, Ripple has been seeing increased action due to day traders,"" said Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments.  ""Day traders looking to speculate will purchase the lesser valued investment, in this case Ripple, in order to try and leverage it for maximized profits,"" he added.

Alongside major developments in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, other altcoins are beginning to gain traction in the broader eye. One such coin is Ripple (XRP), a cryptocurrency known for its connection with the banking world. Disclosure: I own some XRP. 24 hours ago, the price of XRP was $0.27. Earlier this morning (PST), it hit $0.51—an increase of 84 percent. At the time of this writing the price is $0.46 (CoinMarketCap). 
 What you need to know about Ripple Alongside its cryptocurrency, Ripple operates as a payment network called RippleNet. The goal of the platform is to optimize easy transfer of funds—to almost any other currency or cryptocurrency in the world in 4 seconds. Ripple is working with banks and financial institutions to become the premier cryptocurrency of record, offering a quick, cost-effective way to transfer funds globally. For example, if you wanted to send your friend in Italy $50, you could trade for $50 worth of XRP, and they could quickly trade that out for Euros. So why has XRP gone up so quickly? The increased activity in Bitcoin following Cboe launching Bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 10, is generating more activity around the entire cryptocurrency world. As the #4 (and occasionally #5 when Litecoin surpassed it) cryptocurrency, of course Ripple has felt the, well, ripple effect.Continued from page 1 Shutterstock Another explanation is that as the Bitcoin craze cools off, more people are trading for Ripple—which some see as a more stable asset. ""I think that markets view XRP as a very stable digital asset, so they feel safe parking funds in XRP when they exit other assets. If someone wants to get out of BTC, but doesn't want to necessarily move into fiat, he or she moves the value into XRP,"" said Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets at Ripple in an interview with Coindesk. Especially as network speeds lag and transaction fees soar on Bitcoin, Ripple may be an appealing trading alternative with its super-fast speeds. AMEX Partnership 
 Unlike many cryptocurrencies, whose ethos moves away from traditional banking and financial institutions, Ripple seeks to use the new technology to optimize how money is moved. To that end, a recently announced partnership with American Express could be driving buzz around XRP. Ripple will be working with AMEX to ""solve liquidity shortfalls in remittances by offering instant blockchain-based payments."" ""American Express has a long history of integrating new technologies...,” said American Express Chief Information Officer Marc Gordon, in a statement. “This collaboration with Ripple and Santander represents the next step forward on our blockchain journey, evolving the way we move money around the world.” ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2017/12/13/ripple-price-surges-84-in-a-day-to-new-record-high-is-xrp-the-next-crypto-rocket-to-the-moon/,0.5454545454545454,0.0,4,0
12,2017-12-22 15:28:00,Ripple,forbes,5 Reasons Why The Ripple (XRP) Price Continues To Surge In The Face Of Crypto Market Corrections,"Shutterstock The XRP price is way higher than it was at the start of the month—even thriving amid yesterday's 20 percent crypto market drop-off—here's why.   December has been a banner month for XRP, the native asset of Ripple. The first surge took place Dec. 12-13, wherein Ripple leapt 84 percent—from $0.27 to $0.51. In the days that followed, it grew again, finding a resistance barrier around the $0.75 mark. Then, yesterday, Ripple shot for the moon again, surging 64 percent in 17 hours past the $1 milestone, progressing all the way to $1.37. Disclosure: I own some XRP. Pretty astounding for a coin that began December trading at $0.24. A little over a dollar might not immediately sound like a huge change, but that's well over 400 percent growth in one month. Though we witnessed a major drop-off yesterday, wherein the overall cryptocurrency market cap dropped by as much as 20 percent, Ripple has been hit proportionately less than others, remaining above its yesterday mark. 
 So what's causing this explosion in price? Here are 5 reasons. Shutterstock Late-November saw Bitcoin crack $10K, and shortly thereafter the announcements of bitcoin futures trading on Cboe and CME. The attention that ensued—both from the media and mainstream—has been unprecedented in the world cryptocurrency, drawing hordes of newcomers to the space. Many of these newcomers begin their crypto journey on popular brokerage Coinbase (more on this in a minute). For most of December, Coinbase only supported three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). Of those three, most investment has traditionally poured into BTC and ETH, but early this month, we saw consumers graduate to Litecoin, causing several major jumps, peaking at $390 before coming to rest around $320. Now that Litecoin has hit its initial resistance barrier, the natural impact has been that motivated participants have sought new avenues for investment. This has precipitated wild growth among many different cryptocurrencies, including: TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), QTUM, Verge (XVG), and Reddcoin (RDD), among many others—bringing the overall cryptocurrency market cap to a record high of $611B before the Bitcoin drop-off we saw yesterday, which brought it back to $508B at the time of this writing. As one of the oldest, most established and time-tested cryptocurrencies, it's no surprise that investors turned to it early in their crypto investing.Continued from page 1 American Express Co. chip credit cards are arranged for a photograph in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, Oct. 16, 2017. American Express is expected to release third-quarter earnings figures on October 18. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg As a team of finance, technology and fintech veterans, Ripple has demonstrated a clear understanding that an emphasis on partnerships and customer acquisition is an invaluable way for emerging technology companies to thrive. Ripple now has over 75 commercially deploying customers—and over 100 currently on their roster. But more than just establishing a customer base, Ripple has used strategic partnerships to generate buzz. For instance, the recently announced partnership with American Express was many Americans' first encounter with Ripple—and immediately situated the brand as a reliable financial service, rather than a weird or intimidated new technology. 
   While these efforts have generated organic press, Ripple is also clearly doubling down on its media effort—with coverage ramping up over the past month. More notably, last week the San Francisco company hired Tom Channick, the former corporate communications manager for Facebook's advertising and business integrity unit, as its head of communications. Asia plays a key role in this strategy. As Ken Rapoza pointed out, Asians are ""going mad"" for Ripple. This is not an unfounded claim; last year, Ripple partnered with SBI Holdings to launch SBI Ripple Asia to serve markets in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and ASEAN countries by establishing a dedicated sales and engineering group tasked with selling and installing solutions for cross-border bank payments. ""People feel comfortable with its name and the technology behind Ripple,"" said Trevor Koverko, CEO of Polymath, in an interview with Rapoza. ""A lot of people are beginning to realize how big of an opportunity there is between business and the blockchain...and that's making Ripple the early winner here."" A branded coffee mug is seen at the Coinbase Inc. office in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Friday, Dec. 1, 2017. Coinbase wants to use digital money to reinvent finance. In the company's version of the future, loans, venture capital, money transfers, accounts receivable and stock trading can all be done with electronic currency, using Coinbase instead of banks. Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg The effect of this media boom is a major uptick in rumors that Coinbase will soon support XRP buying, selling, and trading on its platform. The widespread assumption is that if that occurs, a whole new crop of buyers will start investing in XRP. For perspective, Coinbase is adding around 100,000 new users per day and recently surpassing YouTube as the #1 app on the Apple App Store. The recent addition of Bitcoin Cash, which caused a media frenzy on Dec. 19, demonstrates the weight Coinbase holds in cryptocurrency worldwide. Many coins right now are bought and traded based on pure speculation—and there's nothing wrong with that per se; it's how many young altcoins with great ideas will flesh out their networks before they're fully operational. But it also means that those currencies are backed almost exclusively by ideas and public belief in those ideas, which is a dangerous position to be in when something like yesterday's drop comes into play. Positioned as a multi-pronged solution for major financial institutions (which aren't going away any time soon), Ripple is actually a useful product to its customers now—regardless of what it will or will not build in the future—and these customers happen to be some of the biggest financial institutions in the world. And it's speed (4-second transactions) and low fees also make it appealing to general consumers. This is also supported by how Ripple itself functions. XRP is a pre-mined coin, which has drawn criticism for going against the ethos of decentralization and the lack of mining opportunities that creates. Moreover, Ripple retains a full 20 percent of the total supply of XRP. While this too has upset some in the crypto community, it also somewhat immunizes it to the volatility we see in other coins. As Techno Rajji explains in an article written for Oracle Times last month: Due to this limited number of XRP coins, the currency may continue to flourish or at least hold its ground in the future if crypto prices fall. For better or worse, higher supply means lower volatility, and more centralization means more moderation of the market. So, will the current growth rate last? Current market trends indicate that we've touched the nearest resistance barrier after $1 ($1.25). According to Sam Bourgi on Hacked, the next major resistance barrier is $1.50. Taking the past few weeks as an example, we might expect to see a few weeks of trading in the $1.25-$1.35 range to solidify the base before another big jump toward the $1.50 mark. Of course, that's leaving out a sudden event such as a Coinbase announcement or a crypto market correction. On the other hand, in ""The Bear Case For XRP: Bitcoin Futures Edition,"" Kyle Samani makes the case for a less optimistic view, questioning the long-term validity of XRP's use cases against more a established coin like Bitcoin while acknowledging that XRP still might have a substantial amount of growth left: We maintain our position: in the long run, we’re bearish on XRP. We simply don’t see any series of events that can occur that would cause financial institutions to voluntarily adopt XRP over the global reserve. Having said that, given the state of crypto markets today, XRP could keep pumping. There’s really not a good objective valuation model for XRP given the intrinsic velocity problem that it faces, so it could 5x before our thesis is reflected in XRP price movements.

Shutterstock The price of Ripple's XRP token has plunged more than 40% from the all-time high it reached last week. The XRP token had fallen to as little as $2.25 at the time of report, representing a roughly 41.4% decrease from the all-time high of $3.84 attained last week, according to CoinMarketCap. At this latest price, XRP was down roughly 33.6% over the last 24 hours, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.    
 As for what caused the digital token to suffer such a sharp decline, analysts pointed to several causes. CoinMarketCap Excludes Korean XRP Prices CoinMarketCap recently decided to exclude XRP prices provided by Korean exchanges from its average price. This move has been credited with causing the digital token to lose roughly $20 billion worth of market capitalization (market cap) around 05:00 UTC today.  Cryptocurrency trader Marius Rupsys emphasized that this move had a ""big impact,"" as the XRP price on Korean exchanges is 50%+ higher than it is on Western exchanges. Profit Taking Other analysts emphasized the strong run the digital token has had lately, noting that it may very well have been time for traders to begin taking profits. A certain amount of this activity was ""inevitable,"" said Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director for eToro. Brad Chun, chief investment officer of hedge fund Shuttle Fund Advisor, also singled out profit taking as a major factor helping push XRP prices lower.  Market Correction Some market observers claimed that XRP was bound to experience a correction, emphasizing how far and how fast its price climbed. ""Ripple's correction was overdue,"" said Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, a subsidiary of 360 BlockChain.  This pullback fit in to a broader trend, he said. ""It was a very good weekend for the altcoins, and today we're seeing corrections across the board.""  Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro, emphasized that after rising more than 1,000% over the last month, a sizable pullback is to be expected.

The digital currency rose to as much as $2.20, climbing more than 50% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The XRP token has been having a blockbuster month, appreciating more than 700% since starting out December with a price of roughly $0.25, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.   A Great Month For Ripple The digital currency has enjoyed several brief rallies this month. 
 One example is the sharp increase XRP experienced roughly mid-December, where it surged more than 90% in 24 hours, reaching roughly $0.87 as investors responded to news that Ripple completed its cryptographic lockup of tokens. The cryptocurrency enjoyed another short rally approximately one week later, climbing to $1.24 as it benefited from sustained momentum and robust Asian trading. XRP's price approached $1.50 earlier this week, pushing higher amid news that Tokyo-based SBI Ripple Asia announced a consortium created to explore how distributed ledger technology could be used for payment cards. Shifting Investor Priorities More recently, analysts have focused on the shifting sentiment of investors, emphasizing that XRP has been benefiting from these changes. Originally, many of those who advocated cryptocurrencies favored these digital assets because of their decentralized nature, said Marius Rupsys, a digital currency trader. These market participants disliked Ripple's centralized nature, opting to trade digital currencies that were decentralized, he stated. However, the digital currency market's size has swelled this year, climbing from roughly $17.7 billion to more than $600 billion this month, CoinMarketCap figures show. According to Rupsys, the new investors that are flooding the market are more interested in the return they might generate than the decentralization and immutability that many Libertarians would value.

The digital currency has hit several milestones as of late, becoming the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and breaking through the $3 price level.   
 When providing explanation for why XRP tokens have enjoyed sustained appreciation as of late, analysts have cited several factors, including news of partnerships, speculation that Coinbase will add the digital currency and sustained momentum. Bank Partnerships Chris Keshian, co-founder of the Apex Token Fund, a tokenized crypto fund-of-funds, recently emphasized Ripple's partnerships with banks, asserting that this news has helped play a key role in driving XRP prices higher.  Sean Walsh, a partner at venture capital firm Redwood City Ventures, also spoke to these partnerships, asserting that they have been a major factor helping fuel the digital currency's recent gains.  Coinbase Speculation Rumors have been circulating that Coinbase, a major cryptocurrency exchange, will soon offer XRP trading.

Strong Momentum XRP has been experiencing strong momentum as it benefits from positive news and continued price appreciation. ""XRP is being covered by every major news channel,"" emphasized Garcon.  As the digital currency continues to rise in price, Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) may be taking over and fueling further gains, said Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of data platform CryptoCompare.

Answers by Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, on Quora: Q: What will set XRP apart from other cryptocurrencies? 
 A: What sets XRP apart from the other major digital assets is that XRP is highly performant and optimized for institutional use in global payments. While I’m personally loving BTC and a believer that it’s solving a different use case, the reality is that today the average time to complete a BTC transaction is about four hours. In contrast, XRP is about four seconds. A couple of other similar comparisons important for payments and enabling an Internet of Value: ... Q: What are some things about Blockchain that are just hype? A: Blockchain is like the new big data or AI - too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem. We like to call them Blockchain tourists! There are many applications that are nothing more than science experiments. Some of the uses being implemented for blockchain could actually work better with a database. There are examples out there that blockchain is not most applicable for and that is why Ripple is focused on a real world use case, solving a real (and very large) customer problem, which has converted into commercial traction that is unmatched in the enterprise blockchain space. ... Q: How close are we to XRP being adopted by the banks?Continued from page 1 A: Some of our customers are already in the early stages of using xRapid, Ripple’s XRP liquidity solution. Payments into emerging markets can require multiple currency traders (added costs) and pre-funded local currency accounts in the destination (trapped, dormant capital). Instead, payment providers and banks can use XRP to fund these payments on demand, without intermediaries, at a cost that is less than half of the current cost. But it’s safe to say that we have to crawl before we walk before we run. This is uncharted territory for banks and payment providers and it’s going to take time before you see broad adoption of digital assets solving this multi-trillion dollar opportunity. Suffice it to say, we are very pleased by the interest from various pilots our customers are already running.

Rupsys noted that he has spoken with some payment processors, and they are ""pretty excited about the technology as it allows them to offer almost instant settlement and cheaper compared to current bank system.""  Greenspan noted that while investing in many cryptocurrencies represents a departure from the current financial system, ""An investment on Ripple seems to be more level-headed because it's intention is to integrate with the current banking network and make it stronger."" Changing Investor Preferences Rupsys spoke to changing investor preferences, emphasizing that the retail and institutional investors who have been flocking to digital currencies have different priorities from the old guard. He stated that: Crypto community is expanding from early bitcoin adopters to mainstream and institutional investors. Early crypto investors were very much for decentralization, immutability and other libertarian ideas. New crypto participants do not hold same views as they are in crypto for different reasons - mainly financial incentives.

20,2017-12-27 17:08:00,Ripple,forbes,"Ripple Rally Continues, Pushing Currency To Latest All-Time High","XRP's price reached a fresh, all-time high today. Shutterstock The price of Ripple's XRP token hit a new record today, adding to the string of all-time highs the digital token has attained this year. XRP rose to as much as $1.43 today, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price, the digital token - which powers the Ripple network - had risen 30% in the last 24 hours, more than 450% in the last month and over 20,000% year-to-date (YTD).   When explaining XRP's latest price climb, analysts pointed to a few different factors. Payment Card 'Consortium' 
 Today, Tokyo-based SBI Ripple Asia - founded by Ripple and Japanese financial services firm SBI Holdings - announced the creation of a ""consortium"" designed to investigate the role that distributed ledger technology could play in card payments, according to an online translation of a press release.  Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, described this development as the only major news involving Ripple. However, he emphasized that digital currencies have been growing more popular in Japan, a development that may have helped lay the foundation for XRP's latest price gains. ""Ripple is huge in Japan and Japanese interest in crypto currencies in general has skyrocketed (based on trading volume) over the past six months,"" he stated.  Enneking also emphasized that ""It’s also in SBI Ripple’s best interests to hype XRP,"" ""so one must bear that in mind as well.""  Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro, offered a different point of view, asserting that while ""This news of this new consortium does seem to be adding fuel to the fire,"" the latest announcement is only part of what has been driving XRP higher lately.  Ripple's Resilience While some cryptocurrencies experienced notable volatility lately, ""Ripple has been one of the first cryptos to really recover from the Christmas doldrums,"" noted Greenspan.  ""It was well outperforming its peers in the surge leading up to the holidays and had quintupled in a week before the peak on December 22nd,"" he emphasized.  Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, highlighted XRP's value, pointing to ""Its stability and mainstream use cases.""  Even after hitting its recent high of $1.43, ""Ripple is still a buy-and-hold,"" said Koyen.

21,2018-01-03 13:23:00,Ripple,forbes,"I Just Made $3000 Investing In Ripple, And It's A Dangerous Feeling","Shutterstock The other week, gripped by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) and the tantalizing feeling that I could still become super rich if I were to only stop equivocating and make a bet, I bought some cryptocurrency. It felt like millionaires were being minted overnight, and that I could no longer afford not to be one, to be stuck working at a job like a sucker. This was mid-December, when Bitcoin was still rocketing up and nobody really knew what to do with it. I had missed the Bitcoin boat, that much was clear, but like so many others I was determined not to miss the next one. Armed with just enough information to be dangerous, I downloaded Coinbase -- the noob's choice.   I noticed Litecoin, which had yet to make the sort of leap that Bitcoin had already made. But I was busy that day and didn't get around to it -- Litecoin went from $90 to north of $300 in an instant, another boat missed another bout of FOMO. Determined not to be left behind again, I bit the bullet and made a small bet on Ethereum, and just like that, it doubled too. From one perspective, I was happy -- money for nothing. From another, psychologically powerful perspective, I was frustrated. I didn't see the money I made, I once again saw the money I had missed by not making a much larger bet -- gamblers out there might recognize this feeling. I pressed on, convincing myself I knew what I was doing. 
 From there, so-called ""altcoins"" seemed the obvious choice. Bitcoin was doing well but didn't appear likely to deliver the mind-spinning gains that it had done in the past -- for those you'd have to pick up something less established. I did my research -- the sort of research that takes place primarily in a Google search bar and a few Reddit forums but still qualifies as research -- and I went with Ripple (XRP). Ripple was unpopular with the Redditors for its centralization, but I had the feeling that this current wave of crypto-interest was coming less from the techno-libertarian set that had kicked off Bitcoin and more from institutional and mainstream small investors. It had actual utility for international bank transfers, increasing hints of partnerships with large organizations and rumors about the sort of Coinbase listing that had recently spun Bitcoin Cash into the stratosphere. Ripple came at a low price of just under $1, even if that low price was somewhat deceptive given the massive supply that would necessarily keep it from reaching Bitcoin-like price heights without consuming the entire world's economy. Still, not everyone knows that, and I figured that the low sticker price might entice enough investors like myself to start pumping the thing. Which is just to say: I made a semi-informed decision and placed my chips. I could just have easily been wrong, but it turned out I was right, and my initial investment has doubled. I didn't quite buy it at the price I wanted because an overloaded Coinbase was taking forever to turn US Dollars into the Bitcoin I would need to buy the Ripple -- but I did get in before a giant surge, and that surge continues at the time of this writing. Again there was that feeling, the feeling unmistakable to any gambler that's ridden a high, however short or long. There's the elation of being right as well as the feeling that it isn't quite money for nothing, that you made this money because you are smart and savvy. And because everyone starts with a small bet, that feeling is soon followed by the notion that you should keep playing. And not only keep playing, but play bigger. Had I made twice as big a bet that first time around, after all, I would have made twice as much money. Had I thrown every last dime I have to my name I would have wound up with twice as many dimes. But the ease with which money comes to the gambler, as so many old sayings will tell you, is matched only by the ease with which it leaves. Maybe I would have doubled my life savings, but maybe I'd be broke. Shutterstock We know this on an intellectual level -- that gambling has some serious drawbacks. But that applies to everyone else, and my bet landed. Who's to say my next bet won't land? Or maybe I should go into full day-trading territory, liquidate my Ripple and try to either buy it again at a lower price or throw that cash into something with the potential to double more quickly. It's tempting. Right now, at least for the somewhat-informed investor and perhaps for more investors than would describe themselves that way, cryptocurrencies feel like a roulette wheel with an opaque piece of plastic covering all the numbers. In real roulette there are a bunch of red tiles, a bunch of black tiles, and a single green tile. That green tile isn't included in any of the grouped bets, and it's the key to the game. It means that if you bet on red or black an infinite number of times, you're bound to lose because the odds come in just under 50-50. And because the house is betting an essentially infinite number of times, it means that Casinos can safely place roulette wheels prominently on their floors. In the crypto wheel, however, one gets the feeling that there are more black tiles than red tiles, maybe even many more. Maybe making bets and seeing where they land is actually the correct economic strategy because the odds are better than 50-50. And I think that idea may be right, at least for now. The space feels like it's in expansion, and right now there's money to be made, even if it is indeed a bubble. It's why even nonsense bets on a meme-oriented coin created as a joke could have yielded 90 times your initial investment. But if we play for long enough we might take that cover off and discover that it was really all green tiles and that the house is walking away with all our money. Bitcoin has minted millionaires,  but it's estimated that around 1000 people own 40% of the market. This is even more true with Ripple. The headline states that I've made around $3000 from my bets, which is true and not true. Yes, the value of the cryptocurrency I have purchased has increased by about $3000 since I purchased it. But I don't have that $3000 right now, I just have a bunch of cryptocurrency. I will have made $3000 if and only if I decide to cash it out. But would I be losing money or making money by doing that? And what if I literally just lose all of it, through any number of the dumb ways I might lose access to my store? Questions for another day. For now, I'll let it ride.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token rose more than 60% in the space of 24 hours to attain its latest all-time high, as the digital currency benefited from robust Asian trading activity and sustained momentum. XRP climbed to as much as $1.24 today, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price level, the cryptocurrency had surged 62% over the last 24 hours.   'Second Wind' This latest price spike took place when traders latched on to XRP's momentum, creating a ""second wind"" for the currency, according to Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro. 
 The token's latest rally came several days after the cryptocurrency spiked more than 90% in the space of 24 hours, a development attributed to traders' desire to diversify and Ripple's announcement that it had locked up 55 billion XRP tokens. When describing the recent upswing in XRP tokens, Greenspan said the following: ""It's part of this same action we've been seeing for the last few weeks."" ""With the choppy action that's happening in this market, cryptotraders are latching on to momentum."" Asian Influence Robust trading in the Asian markets also helped fuel the sharp increase in XRP, according to CoinMarketCap data. At the time of report, XRP/KRW trading on South Korean exchange Bithumb accounted for more than 25% of all XRP trading volume in the last 24 hours. Further, Korbit and Coinone each accounted for roughly 6% of all XRP/KRW activity on the platform. The outsize influence of South Korean trading is part of a broader trend, emphasized Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of digital currency platform CryptoCompare. Some altcoins have a 25% premium when traded using the South Korean won, he noted. Investors Seek 'Pragmatic Projects' Tokens like XRP could benefit as investors seek out projects that are more practical and can be used currently, said Yazan Barghuthi, project lead at Jibrel Network.  He elaborated, stating: ""I think as investors become more knowledgable and seek higher returns - pragmatic projects that can be implemented today, such as Ripple / XRP, will be preferred over ambitious longer-term projects that won't materialize or bear fruit in the short / medium term.""

 Earlier this year, Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen was worth as much as $20 billion. Chris Larsen Cofounder, Ripple Crypto Net Worth: $7.5 billion - $8 billion* The richest man in crypto is Chris Larsen, a Stanford M.B.A. and veteran Silicon Valley operator who at the January market peak fleetingly had a fortune of some $20 billion, the bulk of it derived from his 5.2 billion XRP, the token of Ripple, the company he cofounded with Jed McCaleb in 2012 to facilitate international payments for banks using blockchain technology. His company controls 61 billion of the 100 billion XRP in supply. Forbes is calculating his net worth based solely on the XRP he owns personally and the value of his 17% stake in Ripple, against the company's most recent valuation: $410 million. Ripple counts Mitsubishi Financial, Bank of America and Santander among its 100-plus customers. A serial entrepreneur, Larsen, 57, cofounded the online mortgage lender e-Loan, in 1997, and, eight years later, Prosper, the peer-to-peer lender that has been valued at more than $1 billion. He seems to have hit it bigger here, even if XRP is nothing more than a speculation vehicle — and one that's down 65% since the beginning of the year. While Larsen stepped down from the company more than a year ago, he still serves as executive chairman and tells Forbes he's ""100% focused on Ripple and helping the team any way I can."" Given these kind of numbers, he'd be crazy not to.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP experienced notable upside recently, pushing higher as cryptocurrencies enjoyed widespread gains. The price of XRP rose to as much as $0.9314 today, according to CoinMarketCap.  At this level, the digital token had climbed close to 20% since the start of the day and nearly 25% over the last 24 hours, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.  ] Broad Market Rally The broader cryptocurrency market pushed higher today, surpassing a total value of $400 billion for the first time since earlier this week. 
 Further, 48 of the 50 top digital currencies listed on CoinMarketCap were up at the time of report. However, XRP's gains exceeded those of many top digital currencies. Ether and Litecoin, for example, were up 5.8% and 6.3% over the last 24 hours, CoinMarketCap data reveals. Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments, shed light on this situation.  ""With the recent news of bans and a market wide selloff, we saw Ripple take an exaggerated pullback,"" he stated. Ripple Rebounds However, Thorngren described the Ripple platform as the ""wave of the future"" for institutional transactions. ""It makes sense that we see XRP rebound stronger that the other options available,"" he added. Cryptocurrency trader and investor Marius Rupsys offered a similar perspective, stating that: ""Many cryptocurrencies are rebounding after the drop."" Ripple prices recently fell more than 80% in a short time frame, he emphasized, adding that ""Many coins that sold hardest are being bought."" Positive Outlook Going forward, more than one analyst offered a positive outlook for XRP. Ripple has had ""plenty of positive news"" about financial institutions testing its technology, emphasized Rupsys.

25,2013-12-19 10:01:00,Ripple,forbes,Digital Currencies: Misadventures With Bitcoin Rival Ripple (XRP),"***Update: This article has been updated with relevant new information. See below. It would be quite the understatement to assert that digital currencies are growing in popularity. The frenzy surrounding Bitcoin - the preferred currency of libertarians, porn addicts and crack dealers - has sparked a global craze, attracting the attention of techies and speculators, alike. Piggybacking off the Bitcoin furor, other digital currencies have fought to get a piece of the action. One of the more promising ones is called Ripple (XRP), which has raised funds from

 percent return on investment -- I figured I might as well try my hand at investing in Ripple. Inconveniently, Ripple Labs doesn't accept cash directly. Instead, you have to use what is referred to as a ""gateway"" - a site that will accept cash and deposit it into your ""Ripple Wallet"" on your behalf... for a nominal fee, of course. 
 As part of Ripple's grand strategy of giving away billions of Ripples to encourage early adopters, the new Seattle-based gateway called SnapSwap was giving away 500 Ripples to anyone who used their service to transfer $10 into a Ripple Wallet. I took them up on their offer, and I received my $10 after a couple of business days. But I never got my 500 Ripple reward. No matter, I thought. It will arrive. So, I sent another $100 to SnapSwap, hoping to eventually exchange the money for Ripples and to claim another 300 Ripple reward. That was on Dec 3rd. Unfortunately, I haven't heard from my money since then. (This has since been resolved. See update below***.) Getting anyone to help has been rather difficult. SnapSwap's customer support line -- in which a gentleman with a heavy Russian accent greets you -- neither answers the phone nor returns voice mail. Their e-mail support isn't much better: I got a response telling me they were busy. Frustrated, I turned to Twitter. I really disliked doing that, but I felt as if I had no other option. I was being ignored. So, I publicly notified them that I hadn't received my money. This sparked an active discussion in which a Twitter account that appears to be associated with Ripple Labs -- but actually is not an official Ripple Labs account (see update below***) admitted wrote that people like me weren't all that important to them:  Apparently, the Ripple philosophy is The message that ""bigger accounts matter more than smaller ones"" is definitely not consumer-friendly advice. I'm pleased to learn, however, that this is not Ripple's philosophy. (See update below***.) Fair enough, I suppose. But I can't imagine that reminding small investors of their irrelevance is a wise strategy for attracting more of them. ***UPDATE: 20-Dec-13, 6:00 a.m. PST.  Since writing this article, I have been contacted by both Ripple Labs and SnapSwap, and I have now received all of my money. I am obviously happy with this outcome, but there are several points worth making. First, the reason my money hadn't appeared in my Ripple Wallet was because SnapSwap had a problem with my account. That is a legitimate excuse, in my opinion, but I should have been contacted. Certainly, 15 days is a long enough period of time for me to have received proper notification. I shouldn't have had to make a public complaint to receive adequate customer service. Second, from a branding perspective, Ripple Labs should be careful with whom it associates. As commenter Seth Hoskins noted, Ripple's reputation will be partially judged by those with whom they conduct business. Currently, SnapSwap is not making them look very good.Continued from page 1 Third, it was brought to my attention that the Twitter account XRP Ripple Helpdesk is not officially affiliated with Ripple Labs. The confusion that the Twitter conversation created prompted Ripple to request that the user make clear that he operates independently of Ripple Labs. The user has complied and appears legitimately interested in helping new Ripple customers. However, he should be mindful of how his interactions with others -- even well-intended ones -- impact Ripple and its reputation. Finally, better lines of communication between Ripple Labs, its gateways and its customers needs to be established in short order. Scaling up business quickly can be difficult, but it's necessary in order to prevent customer frustration.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token declined today, outpacing the losses suffered by many other digital currencies. The price of XRP fell to as little as $1.17, a roughly 18% decline from its daily high of $1.43, CoinMarketCap figures show. At the time of report, the digital token had bounced back somewhat, trading at $1.212, but had still fallen more than any other top 10 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. XRP experienced these losses as the broader digital currency market also moved lower, its total market capitalization (market cap) falling more than 13% between its daily high and low, additional CoinMarketCap data reveals.  ] Wary Investor Sentiment 
 Several analysts pointed to nervous investors when explaining why cryptocurrencies were pushing lower today. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital, spoke to this trader sentiment. ""With the massive dip we saw last week, it's likely that investors who were shaken by the volatility - but smart enough not to sell at the bottom - are simply taking their profits while they can, or pulling out while they're breaking even."" Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments, offered similar input.  ""With the stock market continuing to rise and the government shutdown happening, there is more uncertainty in terms of investment,"" he said.  ""Investors are looking to shy away from crypto, as it comes with less certainty, and invest in options they are more confident in perusing due to familiarity.""  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of data provider CryptoCompare, emphasized that the markets are ""still shaky"" because investors are ""skittish."" Ripple's Decline Ripple's XRP token has fallen more than the broader cryptocurrency markets because there is significant uncertainty surrounding the digital asset, said analysts. ""Ripple is definitely trying to find its equilibrium after the meteoric growth it experienced in 2017,"" said DiPasquale.  ""The market still isn't certain what the true valuation of XRP is, based on the role it plays in the larger Ripple infrastructure. Also, people have been holding Ripple since it was pennies, so the growth is intense and we have to remember the bigger picture of its immense growth these year.""  Collin Plume, president of Noble Alternative Investments, also emphasized that the market is having a difficult time determining XRP's price. He said: Ripple has not recovered in short-term pricing since Coinbase dispelled the rumors that it was going to be the next coin on the platform.  In a normal market this coin would have stabilized with the announcement of the partnership with MoneyGram. Ripple will continue to be a volatile coin until the effects of the MoneyGram partnership are established.   Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token has risen sharply in the last few days, climbing almost 90% in the space of 24 hours after suffering a steep decline. The digital token rose to as much as $1.71 today, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price, XRP was up roughly 88% over the space of 24 hours, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.   Ripple's Roller Coaster Ripple's XRP token has been on a roller coaster the last few weeks, climbing to an all-time high of $3.84 earlier this month. 
 While this sharp rise generated many headlines, the digital asset soon went in to a free fall, which resulted in its price falling below $1 on January 16 and quickly reaching a local low of $0.898, CoinMarketCap data shows. Speculative Nature Several analysts have pointed to XRP's speculative nature when explaining why the digital asset's price has been so volatile. ""Ripple is certainly a highly speculative asset,"" said Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of data provider CryptoCompare.  Because the digital currency is driven largely by speculation, it makes XRP highly sensitive to brief changes in sentiment, stated Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management.  XRP's markets are ""less developed,"" meaning that it has less liquidity than Bitcoin, said Hayter. As a result, ""it takes less trading volume to move XRP,"" he said. In other words, XRP's low trading volume makes it more vulnerable to market manipulation.  Natural Bounce Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, took a different tack, describing XRP's recent recovery as a natural bounce following sharp losses.  Ripple was ""one of the most damaged altcoins during the latest rout,"" he emphasized. ""It is only natural that it rebounds aggressively.""

 Recently, the digital currency markets have been plagued by numerous tumultuous events that have provide headwinds for prices.

Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments, offered a similar point of view, stating that ""XRP is seeing a sell-off from the latest news out of China. Cryptocurrency Market 'Being Battered' At this point, the market is being fueled by fear, said Hayter. ""The entire crypto market is being battered,"" said Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA.  However, he emphasized that digital currencies are not the only asset class that is in the red, as stocks have also been experiencing a sell-off. While some analysts pointed to the recent weakness in cryptocurrencies, others emphasized that these price fluctuations could simply be the typical rise and fall of market prices.

 ""Ripple had earlier announced that they have struck deals with 3 of the 5 biggest payment processors in the world,"" he noted.  ""Until now the market was treating this as just another rumor,"" said Greenspan.  ""So the announcement today not only delivered good news it also left the taste of anticipation that they may be delivering on their full promise.""  Ripple's 'Strong Partnerships' Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital, also provided positive commentary surrounding the announcement.

DiPasquale stated that ""If Ripple's strong partnerships continue, I expect its value to continue to increase.""  Market Dynamics While the aforementioned analysts cited the MoneyGram announcement as fueling Ripple, recent increase, some market observers pointed to other factors. Ripple suffered a sharp decline recently, which brought it to as little as $1.62 earlier today, a more than 50% decline from its all-time high of $3.84, additional CoinMarketCap shows. Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, described Ripple's recent run up as being ""Just a recovery from a dramatic selloff.""  Ripple Gains Steam Oliver Isaacs, cryptocurrency investor and influencer, stated that Ripple is ""gaining momentum"" on its way back to $3 and eventually $4.  He spoke to the digital currency's growing visibility, stating: ""Ripple has over the past month been gaining mainstream attention from the press and investors a like, not to mention numerous Reddit sub threads, coin aggregation sites and Telegram groups, which has contributed to the strong price action.""  ""Every cryptocurrency investor and hedge fund I have spoken to have asked me about Ripple's potential in the market,"" added Isaacs.

30,2017-12-14 13:58:00,Ripple,forbes,Ripple Up More Than 90% In Last 24 Hours,"Ripple prices surged more than 90% in a day. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News Ripple prices have surged in the last few days, building upon their recent gains to rally more than 90% over the last 24 hours. The price of XRP tokens has climbed to as much as $0.8661, according to CoinMarketCap. By reaching this level, the digital currency has risen roughly 91.9% in the space of 24 hours and upwards of 300% from the weekly low of $0.2222 it reached on December 8, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.   Many of the major digital currencies - including Litecoin, Ether and Bitcoin - have generated compelling gains this year as the digital currency market surged higher. 
 However, Ripple's year-to-date (YTD) increase of more than 11,000% takes the cake. As for what has caused Ripple's price to surge lately, analysts pointed to a few factors. Investors Seek Diversification Several market observers asserted that Ripple's XRP tokens have been pushing higher as investors seek to diversify their portfolios with alternative protocol assets or ""altcoins."" Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, a subsidiary of 360 BlockChain, agreed with this point of view. As mainstream investors rush into crypto, they're looking for bitcoin alternatives — either as a hedge or because bitcoin appears overbought. Litecoin lit up first, then it was Ethereum. These shoppers are working their way down the top-10, looking for safe, familiar names. Ripple fits the bill perfectly. Yazan Barghuthi, project lead at Jibrel Network, offered similar input, stating that the major altcoins have been positioning themselves to draw investment when Bitcoin suffers an inevitable correction. Crypto Lockup Some analysts pointed to Ripple's recent announcement that it completed the cryptographic lockup of XRP tokens that it had promised to do earlier this year. In May, the company revealed plans to place 55 billion XRP tokens in a cryptographically-secured escrow account in order to help ensure the stability of total supply. Ripple revealed that it plans to create 55 smart contracts that will hold 1 billion XRP each. Every month, one of these contracts will expire, making the associated digital tokens available for use. Barghuthi asserted that XRP has gained as investors responded to this news.  ""Ripple recently locked up a large amount of their unfrozen token supply in smart contracts,"" he emphasized. ""While the lock up had implications on price, it is more likely that the uptick in price is the market reacting to this move."" Sean Walsh, a partner at Redwood City Ventures, also spoke to the key role played by this move: In our opinion, there is just one factor responsible for Ripple's recent rise. It is Ripple's Dec 7 followthrough on their May 2017 promise of locking 55 Billion XRP into a time-release escrow. This is over half of their total token supply. This step instantly nullified a key criticism of their network. The first of the six fundamental characteristics of money is that it should be Scarce (SDDRFT).

For obvious reasons: rising government regulations, hacking and the tightening of liquidity by major banks — to mention a few. But with many currencies trading anywhere from 60% to 80% below their all-time highs, and the advance/decline ratio improving, the time may be ripe to go bargain hunting.

Bargain hunting can lose you plenty of money, too. If you end up picking up falling angels: assets with weak fundamentals that are unable to survive the market turmoil, and are crashing back to earth. How can you separate fallen from falling angels? That’s certainly a difficult task for a couple of reasons. One of them is psychology. Most investors would find it hard to rise over the gloom and doom of the present and look over the hills of the future. Another reason is the lack of sufficient information to evaluate the intrinsic value of an asset; and determine whether it’s undervalued or overvalued at current market price. That’s particularly the case when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Because there are hardly any “fundamental” metrics to appraise the “intrinsic” value of each coin, as is the case with conventional assets. Still there’s behavioral finance and technical analysis that provide a few tips to the daring souls ready to sift through the cryptocurrency maze for lucky coins—“fallen angels.” Still, investing on rather than fundamentals is an extremely risky game for very aggressive investors who are prepared to lose a great of money in a short period of time.

32,2018-01-11 11:35:00,Ripple,forbes,"For Ripple, MoneyGram Deal Trumps Talks Of South Korea's Crypto Ban","Ripple coin lives another day. (Shutterstock) Once again, another Asian nation is no match for the blockchain. South Korea's talk of banning cryptocurrency trading sent all of the top traded coins down yesterday and again on Thursday. But one major stands out today, and that's Ripple (XRP). The token tied to the digital payments startup is back trading over $2 thanks to an announced deal with Dallas-based MoneyGram. MoneyGram shares rose over 6% on the news. MoneyGram will allow their customers to send and complete cross-border payments with the XRP token instead of fiat currencies like the dollar. MoneyGram will use the company's xRapid, Ripple’s on-demand liquidity product, Ripple said today.  The system permits real-time foreign exchange settlement through ripple coin, ""which gives financial institutions the ability to unlock liquidity and access multiple corridors with one pre-funded originating account."" 
 Ripple has been rising from a small, relatively unknown cryptocurrency to a top-three behind heavyweights bitcoin and ether. Major venture capital firms and banks have invested in the company, including Google Ventures and Standard Chartered bank. This week, word that the South Korean government would ban trading sent ripples through the crypto market. South Korea, Japan and China account for the lion's share of trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. Demand for cryptocurrency has grown so fast, top exchanges like Bitstamp and Okex are closed to new accounts.  The Korean government still seems noncommittal to the idea of the outright ban of exchanges, something China did late last year. Cryptocurrencies fever is rampant in South Korea. Demand tends to push prices of many tokens nearly 30%  higher than they are on exchanges in other countries, leading to arbitrage purchases by risk-taking locals. The country’s Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said the decision to curb trading is multi-departmental, including members of the Finance Ministry and securities regulators. “There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,” Sang-Ki was quoted saying in Reuters. Asia headlines have been a mixed blessing for MoneyGram. The company made headlines this month following a failed China acquisition. Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group Holding. His company, Ant Financial, was banned from acquiring Texas-based MoneyGram International this month. Now, in a very different type of deal, MoneyGram is partnering with Ripple, a company whose cryptocurrency may end up being banned from South Korea's cryptocurrency exchanges. (Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) The company's attempt to sell to China's Ant Financial, a unit of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant founded by billionaire Jack Ma, was banned just last week by the U.S. government.  MoneyGram said it was unable to obtain the required approval for the transaction from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. ""The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,” MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said in a statement. “Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger. We are disappointed in the termination of this compelling transaction,” he said. MoneyGram is a popular service in emerging markets like China and Brazil, where expats often use it to repatriate cash to family members back home or to pay bills. They can now do so in XRP. This week, two Goldman Sachs economists issued a report titled ""Bitcoin as Money"" arguing that cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin, were more apt to be used as a source of payment in weak currency nations where dollars are scarce. Ripple rose to fame after it announced a pilot program signed between two South Korean banks and a consortium of 61 Japanese banks. It's been on a tear ever since. South Korea pulled a rug out from under it this week, but the MoneyGram news kept it from falling further. That might not hold. Seoul is preparing a bill which will ban all cryptocurrencies from trading on local exchanges. It is unclear how this would impact Ripple's pilot project. The company was unavailable for immediate comment. ""Banning cryptocurrencies altogether would be difficult given that the country is one of the biggest markets in the world, especially for bitcoin and ethereum,"" says Forbes contributor Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist for ThinkMarkets in London. ""Keep in mind that this is not the first time that the regulators have gone after the cryptocurrency market.  During this week alone, we have seen two headlines emerging from South Korea aimed at bitcoin. There is no doubt that the demand for bitcoin in South Korea is massive and some elements of the public's behavior — when it comes to trading the cryptocurrencies — aren’t far from gambling habits."" Traders should not read too much into the South Korean situation, Aslam wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Once the bill is drafted, it would require a backing of 297 members of the National Assembly, a process which could take months or even years. ""Ripple's growth over the past year has been stellar and it has acquired multiple institutional customers who are seriously considering using it for cross-border settlements,"" says Abhishek Pitti, founder of Nucleus.Vision, a visual data company using blockchain technology based in Palo Alto and Hyderabad, India. Mumbai-based Reliance Capital serves as both an advisor and early investor to the company. Draper Ventures founder Tim Draper is also a lead investor in Pitti's company. ""Ripple has shown that they can facilitate double-digit million dollars worth of transactions in seconds, at a fraction of the cost of a bitcoin transaction,"" he says. Pitti thinks XRP will escape South Korea's crypto ban. ""I don't think South Korea is banning cryptocurrencies altogether,"" he says. ""They are clamping down on unregulated exchanges so that shouldn't effect ripple because their primary users are regulated financial institutions.""

33,2017-08-16 11:09:00,Ripple,forbes,Ripple Uses Blockchain To Move Money Faster Than A Flying Courier,"Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, likes to compare speeds of moving money internationally. “If I want to move money from here (San Francisco) to London, the fastest way is to fly there,” he said. “We can stream video from the space station, but I can’t move my own money from A to B, especially for international payments, but that is also true for domestic transfers.” The challenge Ripple is working on is how to use blockchain, or distributed ledger, technology to improve the efficiency, speed and cost of payments. “For anyone in payments, from Visa to SWIFT or Square, the landscape will change as we see friction reduced, and the future will arrive sooner than we think.” Blockchain technologies are compelling in a lot of ways, Garlinghouse added, but a lot of people are all over the map with blockchain ideas, making it look like a technology in search of a problem. 
 Ripple is focused on real world use cases, understanding the real value proposition to banks and customers. Santander's POC experience Last year Santander launched a pilot to use Ripple for international payments in 19 European countries and the U.S., said Ed Metzger, head of technology innovation at Santander in the UK. Santander Innoventures, the bank’s venture capital arm, had made an investment in Ripple, he added.Continued from page 1 “In our pilot we enable staff to send money to any bank in 20 geographies by sending a payment via Ripple and then using a partner in each destination to complete the last mile to the end bank account,” he explained. “International payments only work if you can get the money to where you want it to go. This will greatly improve Santander's internal transfers, but it’s important to be able to send to any bank. With the current setup we were able to get to money to customer accounts the next day. Blockchain for international payments opens up the possibility for instant payments, but as first step we have improved the service to go from multiple days down to next day at the latest.” For Santander, a key issue was finding a solution that worked today and could make a difference to customers today. It developed a mobile app to connect to Ripple. “It’s been very successful; we have very positive feedback from staff members who have used it.” They liked the certainty of when the payment would arrive, which they said was superior to the experience with SWIFT for international payments. “Ripple gives certainty as to when the money would arrive and how much would arrive. If you want 100 euros to arrive, you want to make sure you send exactly the right amount of money to cover any fees taken,  and with SWIFT that is sometimes challenging.” 
 Ripple and its digital asset, XRP While Ripple doesn't rely on bitcoin, it does use its own digital asset, XRP.  (For a discussion of XRP and a look at Hyperledger as an alternative, see the analysis from the  from the pseudonymous P4man at coindesk.) Comparing bitcoin to Napster as an early player that demonstrated the digital aspect of music and proved the technology but didn’t win, Garlinghouse said bitcoin may prove to be a better store of value than a medium for transaction — its average transaction time is over 10 hours at a cost of more than $1, he said, while Ripple can process a transaction in three to four seconds for a fraction of a penny. (Bitcoin’s price has risen above $4,000, more than doubling in the last month, according to coindesk.) Garlinghouse thinks the cross-border payment business is ripe for change. “Do we really think in 10 years out global trans-border payments will take days to settle, built on a system designed in the ‘70s?”Continued from page 2 Ripple will be at Sibos, the annual SWIFT operations conference, he said, and the company has found a growing audience. “They are believers. They think we have been stuck in decades old technology long enough and they would like to see the marketplace move forward.” Ripple provides customers with settlement in three to four seconds with two-way messaging so a user can see that an account number matches the intended recipient. The messaging also shows when a payment has arrived at its destination. The information drives down error rates, he said. Unlike Currency Cloud and TransferWise which aim at companies and consumers, Ripple works with banks, which he described as repositories of value. Ripple now has 75 customers and around 20 have announced their first product use cases, while others are in stage of deployment, he added. For a Ripple bank user to reach a user at a bank that is not a Ripple, banks can work with payment service providers like Earthport, he said. The existing model of correspondent banking has its problems. The number of correspondent banks around the world  dropped by roughly 50 percent over the last 15 years, said Garlinghouse, from 28,000 to about 12,000 The cost of supporting correspondent banking has increased with regulatory compliance and the cost of capital.

34,2017-09-08 19:49:00,Ripple,forbes,Blockchain Enterprise Firms R3 And Ripple Sue Each Other Over $1 Billion Of Cryptocurrency,"As blockchain companies have lost the spotlight this year to the burgeoning, hot world of crypto assets, two of the enterprise blockchain leaders, R3 and Ripple, are now embroiled in a dispute over the cryptocurrency XRP. On Friday, in the Delaware Chancery Court, R3, a consortium of more than 80 financial institutions across the world, sued its partner Ripple, over an options contract to buy more than $1 billion worth of XRP. The same day, in a California state court in San Francisco, Ripple countersued. R3 says in its lawsuit that in September 2016, the companies entered into an agreement, part of which gave R3 the option to purchase 5 billion XRP at an exercise price of $0.0085 between then and September 2019. After soaring more than 3,000% this year, XRP now trades at more than $0.20, making the options worth more than $1 billion. Shutterstock 
 San Francisco-based Ripple uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to make international wire transfers and other forms of cross-border exchange faster and cheaper. New York-based R3 uses similar technology, a distributed ledger which does not use cryptocurrency, as well as its consortium of financial institutions to make multiple banking functions more efficient. The R3 suit claims that, in June 2017, Ripple's current CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emailed R3 CEO David Rutter to terminate the option contracts and asks the court to reinstate the rights granted in it. In its suit, Ripple claims that R3 misled Ripple into entering into partnership agreements, signed in 2016, in which Ripple would benefit from R3's banking partnerships, while R3 would gain not only from the options but also a share of 15% of the revenue Ripple received from any bank participating in their commercial partnership. It alleges that after signing, R3 instead focused its efforts on fundraising. (In May of this year, R3 announced it raised $107 million.) Ripple also alleges that, prior to signing, R3 touted the membership of partners like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who left the consortium after the contract with Ripple was signed. It asks that the court invalidate its agreements and for R3 to pay damages from the breach of its agreement with Ripple in an amount to be determined at trial. “R3 does not discuss the details of pending litigation. We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter,” said R3 in a written statement. A Ripple spokesperson wrote, ""Our filing is straightforward -- R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP’s ~4000% increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement."" R3 has raised $107 million from its consortium banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, HSBC, and Wells Fargo. Ripple has raised $94 million from Andreessen Horowitz, IDG Capital Partners, Santander Innoventures, SBI Investment, Seagate Technology and others. The market capitalization or network value of XRP has skyrocketed this year from $236 million to $8 billion as of Friday. Ripple is believed to own about 60% of XRP in existence.

The payments system company uses blockchain technology and has its own digital token to allow for users to pay for its services. Japan and South Korea are running a pilot program using their system, known as RippleNet. (Shutterstock image) The Asians have discovered a new cryptocurrency you've probably never heard of. Ripple (XRP), a top five cryptocurrency with a whopping $46.2 billion market cap, is up 57.2% on Thursday, beating every major crypto coin out there and surpassing $1 for the first time, based on Coin Market Cap data. ""Asians are going mad for Ripple,"" says Alexey Ivanov, CEO and co-founder of Polynom Crypto Capital, a Moscow-based cryptocurrency and blockchain investment fund manager. Today's price gains are largely driven by Asian crypto gamblers. Ripple has seen trading volumes increase over the last 24 hours by nearly 25% at South Korean exchange Bithumb and 10% on Bitfinex in Hong Kong. Ripple is like a Western Union using blockchain technology. It is a digital payment system that allows for discounts for its service for those who pay to use it in the Ripple coin. The company is run by CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has held senior executive positions at AOL and Yahoo! between 2003 and 2012. The company said last week that a coalition of 61 banks in Japan, organized by SBI Ripple Asia in Tokyo, will launch a new digital payments systems pilot program with Woori Bank and Shinhan Bank of South Korea using the Ripple blockchain network. 
 ""People feel comfortable with its name and the technology behind Ripple,"" says Trevor Koverko, CEO of Polymath, a blockchain platform for startups looking to launch their own cryptocurrencies. ""A lot of people are beginning to realize how big of an opportunity there is between business and the blockchain...and that's making Ripple the early winner here."" See: Bitcoin Prices Might Have Peaked, But Smaller Cryptos Have Not -- Forbes Cryptocurrency investors believe that Asia accounts for at least a third of all cryptocurrency trading volume, with the main adopters coming from Japan, South Korea and China via Hong Kong. While Ripple has a service, its large valuation is dependent on that service actually becoming a payments system companies will want to use. Nearly all startups issuing their own cryptocurrencies are massively overvalued, but investors are pouring into these new coins anyway. Those who are not worried about losing all of their investment capital believe they have nothing but upside once they get over the fact that their investment may become worthless. For those with serious money to burn, the upside is hard to ignore. Investors who put $15 to work to buy just one bitcoin in Dec. 2012 now have over $15,000. Investors believe that if they put the same amount of money into ripple, or other lower priced coins, they might get a similar outcome. For traditional investors, none of this makes much sense, but in these early innings of the bitcoin hype, fundamentals don't matter. ""The entire cryptocurrency industry is exploding and ripple has done a great job positioning itself as one of the key entry points for institutional investors,"" says Rob Viglione, one of the founders behind ZenCash, yet another blockchain infrastructure company geared up towards encrypted, anonymous financial transactions. Investors in these companies have to be prepared to lose their entire investment. ""Ripple started the year worth about one cent and is now at a dollar because of banks in Japan and South Korea testing the use of Ripple's technology for flash-transactions,"" says Ivanov. He does not hold XRP in any of his five blockchain-focused funds. Japan and South Korean banks are expected to start test driving RippleNet in the first quarter. Ripple's San Francisco office was not yet open for immediate comment. The coin will primarily be used or institutions and not for retail transactions like Western Union or PayPal.

Discount on gasoline and other products for all holders of the XOM coin. Until that exists, or until it takes billions of shares off market, the big three cryptocurrencies are set to maintain a healthy pace ahead of America's largest oil company in terms of market capitalization. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) The three largest cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum — now have a combined market capitalization larger than all of Exxon. That means more money is pumping in and out of these three invisible assets than into a stock that has billions more shares out there. So here we have a multinational company with bona fide hard assets and prime real estate, a company that controls a commodity needed to heat homes and keep the lights on with a lower market cap than three entities less than 10 years old. A company's market cap is not a measure of the company's value. Market capitalization is the number of shares outstanding times the stock price. Exxon has over 4 billion shares outstanding as of September. By comparison, bitcoin has only 16.7 million coins in circulation. Ethereum's coin, ether, has 96.7 million.  Ripple has many billions of coins, around 30 billion. So if this coin keeps increasing in value, it will surpass bitcoin due to the sheer number of coins there are available to investors. The coin is worth a little over $2. Two weeks ago it was worth less than $1. Nevertheless, while not a measure of a company's success, financial pundits pay a lot of attention to market cap. Each earnings season, hosts on financial news programs try to guess when Apple becomes the world's first trillion-dollar company.  Their market cap is $878 million. 
 Further south, one of the stars of Brazil's economy, Petrobras, saw its market cap collapse from 2008, when it was nearly $100 billion. It's now worth $67 billion. Ripple (XRP) market cap is $20 billion larger than Petrobras. In fact, there is currently no company in Brazil that has a market cap larger than ripple or ethereum. Bitcoin is more than two times larger by market cap than Itau, Brazil's largest corporation. Bitcoin, Ripple, Etherum Vs.

37,2018-01-16 12:23:00,Ripple,forbes,"I Just Lost $3,000 Investing In Ripple (And Tron), And It's A Dangerous Feeling","Shutterstock It turns out I didn't have $3,000 after all. There was a moment, the other week when it felt like I did, and I wrote about it here. I had made the plunge into cryptocurrency after much hemming, a deal of hawing and a couple of agonizing days watching the price fluctuate as Coinbase chugged my USD into ETH. My first bet on Ripple (XRP) paid off handsomely, though not so handsomely as it would have had I been able to buy it when I wanted to. A subsequent bet on Tron (TRX), worked out even better, and for a moment it even seemed like I had been able to staunch the bleed off of a Ripple peak by moving those coins into Tron -- a successful trade from the successful investor, clearly. You can see where this is going.   Prices collapsed, both across the board but moreso for my coins in particular. The Coinbase coins -- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin -- haven't been hit as hard as the smaller coins, and Ethereum, in particular, is still up overall. But the altcoins are getting hammered, and where there once was money now there is not. Perhaps there never was. The reasons are various: South Korea is considering getting aggressive about regulating cryptocurrencies, and the entire market is suffering as a result. South Korean traders, for a time, seemed to be responsible for the atmospheric rise in Ripple, after all. And then there are the cracks: Ripple is a promising idea for transferring funds, but the reality of it is that there's no reason why banks or businesses would have to use the XRP coin to take advantage of the Ripple platform. Tron was accused of plagiarism and had largely risen on market momentum and obscure promises: the traders left once they realized incredible gains. In a general sense the market got oversold, people took profits and an adjustment was made. No asset can quintuple in value every week. 
 And yet sitting here in midst of a major selloff offers a fascinating glimpse into the mindset of the crypto community. The Reddit communities for Tron and Ripple are as unconcerned right now as they were last week: prices will stabilize at some point, they say, and they'll be back. To many, the price collapse isn't a reason to despair but a reason to rejoice -- it's just a sale on coins. It's time to load up, wait out the saps and return stronger than ever. I don't know when these people bought their Ripple but it's possible that many are still up several multiples despite the recent collapse, and so they may know something I don't.

Some would call it an acronym -- Hold On for Dear Life -- while others would just call it a drunken misspelling of ""hold"" from an old forum post. Regular investors would just call it being long on a stock, but the crypto world has no time for such arcane phraseology. It's the idea that the price will go up, even if already went down. It's the idea that noobs are the ones who panic and sell, but seasoned crpyto investors double down. For some, HODL is a researched position, for others it feels like more of a philosophical stance akin to the power of positive thinking.  For a long time, at least for a number of coins, HODL has been a sound strategy. The space has grown in fits and starts, but it has grown. There's no guarantee that it will keep doing so in the future. And this is where things get dangerous. I believed these coins would succeed two weeks ago: am I really so fickle? And if I haven't stopped believing, why aren't I pouring more money into the market and snapping up the cheap coins before the price skyrockets again. It was just last week I was doing calculations on what price TRX would need to hit for me to make X amount of money: here's an opportunity to bring that price way down. I gave myself a limit on how much I would invest, but are these the thoughts of a sucker? Or are they the last gasp of a rational brain resisting being totally overtaken by a sucker? It turns out that the mind games a selloff plays with you are no different than the mind games a bubble plays with you. Lurking in the middle of all of this is the notion that you are not a leaf on the wind but rather a savvy operator who can best the market trends through grit and guile. There was a sequence of decisions that could have made this all work, after all. I could have recognized the bubble when it happened and moved all of my assets into USDT, a currency meant to stick as close to $1 a coin as possible. Or I could have bought Ethereum, which was going up when other things were crashing. Then I could move back into Tron and Ripple once they hit bottom, losing nothing in real value but tripling or quadrupling my crypto holdings. I had an inkling the price was cresting, after all, and perhaps next time I can just trust that instinct and make each right move at each right time. Perhaps next time that instinct will be dead wrong. I'll hold, though I'm not sure I'm HODL, at least not like those other guys. I always told myself I was making bets and seeing how they'd land: it's the same whether they're down or up. The headline states that I lost $3,000 on Ripple and Tron, which is true and not true -- just like it was when I had made that money. I still have a bunch of cryptocurrency, not USD, and it's still anyone's guess how much it's worth. If only I could stop refreshing that price.

It seems that cryptocurrency markets were in a bubble ripe to burst.   Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.] Still, big banks may have something to do with both helping the bubble blow bigger and making the burst worse than it could have been. There was a time when Wall Street and big banks provided a tailwind for Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. That was back in the last quarter of 2017, when Wall Street began to recognize Bitcoin as an investment, and was creating the vehicles and mechanisms for broader market participation in it. Like the introduction of Bitcoin futures by CME.Continued from page 1 Meanwhile, big banks provided the liquidity for such broad participation by allowing investors to use their credit cards to pay for cryptocurrency purchases – and help the cryptocurrency bubble grow bigger and bigger. How many investors have used their credit cards to buy Bitcoin? 18.15%. That’s according to a recently released LendEDU Bitcoin investor survey. Most notably, 22.13% of those investors who used credit cards to fund their Bitcoin purchases didn’t pay off their credit card balance after purchasing Bitcoin. Now, big banks are cutting off liquidity to the cryptocurrency markets, when they need it the most; and, perhaps, turning a cryptocurrency correction into a crash. Matthew Schutte, Director of Communications, Holo doesn’t see things that way. ""No collusion amidst Wall Street firms or Banks was needed to pop the Bitcoin bubble. Of course, it didn't help either when research reports surfaced pointing out that there was little chance that Bitcoin will replace money for ordinary exchanges thanks to transaction fees in the tens of dollars and settlement times that work fine... for anybody willing to watch a Netflix show while waiting for their payment to go through."" To be fair, banks have a legitimate concern regarding the ability of cryptocurrency investors to pay their credit card balances after the big fall in cryptocurrency prices. But they shouldn’t have lent money to investors to purchase such high-risk assets in the first place and make the bubble worse than it might have been.

Table 1 Seven-Day Price Change For Major Cryptocurrencies 
 Source: Coinmarketcap.com 2/1/18 at 4:30 p.m. Table 2 Apparently, investors have been getting nervous about every asset class, though for different reasons for each. Cryptocurrency investors have been getting nervous over the future of digital money, as big governments and big banks from China to South Korea and the U.S. are trying to set the rules of the game on their own terms. Then there’s the issue of an ever-growing supply of digital currencies, which has approached the 1400-mark, causing both market “dilution” and confusion. And there’s the issue of trust. Most of these digital currencies have no fundamentals behind them, other than a web page that promises to make capitalism efficient; and there’s the potential of fraud that further undermines that trust.Continued from page 1 Equity investors have been getting nervous about equities for a couple of reasons, too. One of them is market valuations, which are getting overstretched by historical levels. Then there’s the fear that free money is coming to an end. The 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond is moving close to 3%, as the corresponding European and Japanese Treasuries have been heading north, too. Meanwhile, a strong payroll report published by the U.S. government on Friday morning makes it more likely that interest rates will continue to climb in the near future. “Once again, this is ‘good news’ for workers, but it hints that wage inflation is taking hold, and that can be ‘bad news’ for the stock market,” says Ken Berman, market strategist at Gorilla Trades. “It gives the Federal Reserve a ‘green light’ on more rate hikes this year, and that historically makes the stock market nervous.” And there’s the growing government deficit, which will force the U.S. Treasury to issue more Treasury bonds to pay for it. 
 That would certainly put further pressure on long-term interest rates, equities, and possibly cryptocurrencies, too.

For obvious reasons: rising government regulations, hacking and the tightening of liquidity by major banks — to mention a few. But with many currencies trading anywhere from 60% to 80% below their all-time highs, and the advance/decline ratio improving, the time may be ripe to go bargain hunting.

Bargain hunting can lose you plenty of money, too. If you end up picking up falling angels: assets with weak fundamentals that are unable to survive the market turmoil, and are crashing back to earth. How can you separate fallen from falling angels? That’s certainly a difficult task for a couple of reasons. One of them is psychology. Most investors would find it hard to rise over the gloom and doom of the present and look over the hills of the future. Another reason is the lack of sufficient information to evaluate the intrinsic value of an asset; and determine whether it’s undervalued or overvalued at current market price. That’s particularly the case when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Because there are hardly any “fundamental” metrics to appraise the “intrinsic” value of each coin, as is the case with conventional assets. Still there’s behavioral finance and technical analysis that provide a few tips to the daring souls ready to sift through the cryptocurrency maze for lucky coins—“fallen angels.” Still, investing on rather than fundamentals is an extremely risky game for very aggressive investors who are prepared to lose a great of money in a short period of time.

For a “technical” reason: it’s broad, extending from major currencies to the smaller ones. When Bitcoin dropped close to 40% back in the middle of December, Ripple rallied, quadrupling in value in just a few days. The rally quickly spread to Ethereum, Litecoin, NEM, Siacoin and Bytecoin, and other cryptocurrencies. Then, as Ripple and other cryptocurrencies sold off a couple of weeks later, Bitcoin rallied. There’s a good explanation behind the rotation among cryptocurrencies. Some cryptocurrency exchanges require Bitcoins to pay for coin transactions. So investors who already owned Bitcoins had to sell them to pay for those transactions. 
 Rotation from one coin to another isn’t new to investing. It has been applied on Wall Street for years, where investors rotate funds between “defensive” and “cyclical stocks,” at times when interest rates, i.e. the “opportunity cost” of money, remain low. That’s bullish for stocks, because it confirms that money is staying within this asset class rather than moving back into money market investments. And that was a bullish sign for cryptocurrencies back then, too.   Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin).Continued from page 1 But that’s not what is happening this time around. With the exception of Ethereum, all major cryptocurrencies are down simultaneously. In the last seven days, Bitcoin is down 10.10%, Ripple is down 17.23%, and Litecoin is down 10.40%; and all are 50% or more below their all-time high back in December.

Sharp upturns have been followed by sharp downturns, with each upturn and downturn lasting only a few weeks or a few days. Thus far, the cryptocurrency roller coaster has helped speculators who have been on the right side of the market to amass fortunes. The trouble is that no speculator is smart enough or lucky enough to “time” the market. At least that’s what mainstream financial economics claims. Seven-Day Price Change For Major Cryptocurrencies

Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.] “Unfortunately, almost anything connected with the future of Bitcoin is speculative right now,” says Jason Labrum, founder and president of Labrum Wealth Management. “When you look at the sophistication level of the average person buying Bitcoin, it’s scary. They just see an asset that at times has gone up a whole lot in value, so you get a herd mentality of people wanting to jump on the bandwagon.” Labrum isn’t clear how things will look in 20 years from now. “It will be interesting in 20 years to look back on the conversations we are having today about Bitcoin. By then, cryptocurrency could be a normal part of everyone’s life, or it could be a once trendy thing that everyone has forgotten about.”Continued from page 1 Matthew Schutte, Director of Communications at Holo, takes a pessimistic view on cryptocurrencies. “By 2038, the euro, the dollar, and other national currencies will be largely extinct, but so will Bitcoin and the rest of the current generation of money-like cryptocurrencies.” But he’s optimistic on blockchain technology. “They will not have been killed off by some single new token of value - but will instead have been replaced by a vibrant ecosystem of cryptographic currencies — i.e. digitally signed signals — each designed to make particular flows of activity visible, so that the individuals, organizations, and communities that make use of them are better able to sense and steer,” adds Schutte. While it’s still unclear where cryptocurrencies and the technologies behind them will be twenty years from now, one thing is clear: volatility will continue in the cryptocurrency markets – and that is a game for speculators rather than investors.

44,2018-01-08 06:50:00,Ripple,cnbc,Ripple will be bigger than bitcoin if it hits $7,"Market capitalization has become an obsession with many cryptocurrency watchers. It refers to the value of the entire digital currency in circulation and is worked out by multiplying the supply of the virtual coin by the price per unit. With bitcoin, the largest cyrptocurrency by market cap, having a quiet start to the year, many investors are looking at alternative cryptocoins. Ethereum and ripple, for example, have seen fairly strong rallies to begin the year. And many are wondering which one could usurp bitcoin as the biggest cryptocurrency. Ethereum and ripple have been jostling for the second spot, and that has changed depending on price.  That jostling turned volatile on Monday as the price of ripple tumbled. Bitcoin also fell, while ethereum gained in value. Ripple's current circulation is 38,739,144,847 digital coins. At Monday's earlier price of $2.49, its market cap was $96.46 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Bitcoin's market cap, meanwhile, was $254.2 billion on Monday. For ripple to surpass this, the cryptocurrency would only need to get to $6.57. This would require a rise of 164 percent. It rose nearly 36,000 percent last year. Ethereum has a circulating supply of 96,846,982. Its current price is $1,119, according to CoinMarketCap. Its market cap is $108.3 billion. Ether would need to rise to around $2,700 to surpass bitcoin's value. This would require a 134 percent rally from Monday morning's price, which is smaller than the rise required by ripple. Both these cryptocurrencies benefit from having larger circulating supplies than bitcoin. It means the price of each digital coin can be lower to achieve a higher market cap. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million with the current supply standing at 16,789,425. With bitcoin's dominance standing at record lows, and alternative cryptocurrencies seeing big price leaps, it's not inconceivable that either ether or ripple could claim the top spot in terms of market cap soon. Of course, if bitcoin sees a surge in price this year, it will make it harder for either cryptocurrency to surpass it. Still, some experts have suggested that ripple has run ahead of itself. Ripple works with large institutions and unlike bitcoin, many of the coins are actually owned by the company. This means it's not as decentralized as bitcoin is.

This is after the cryptocurrency's meteoric rise in value last year. CNBC reported in December that Miller said half the value of his fund was in bitcoin. He said they began buying bitcoin in 2014 or 2015, at an average cost of about $350. Bitcoin is currently trading near $14,935, according to CryptocurrencyMarket.com. Moving it to a separate fund allows investors to decide whether they want to continue to hold or sell it, he told CNBC.

50,2018-01-16 14:29:00,Ripple,cnbc,Ripple is sitting on close to $80 billion and could cash out hundreds of millions per month — but it isn't,"Sixteen months ago, Ripple raised $55 million by selling equity in a typical Silicon Valley funding round from strategic investors, following earlier financing from Alphabet's GV (Google Ventures), Andreessen Horowitz and others. The round placed the value of the company around  $400 million. Today the San Francisco start-up could bring in many times that amount of cash every month -- if it wanted to -- without giving up any company ownership or control.  Ripple develops software that banks use for fast global financial settlements. But almost all of its current value comes from being the creator and majority holder of XRP, a digital currency that was obscure a year ago, but now has a total market value of about $130 billion.  XRP, which trades publicly like bitcoin, went on an inexplicable rally starting last year. Even after plummeting from a high of $3.84 in early January to $1.30 (including a 30 percent drop on Tuesday), it's still up almost 200-fold in the past 12 months.  Ripple owns about 60 billion of the 100 billion XRP created, giving it a market value -- based just on its holdings -- of close to $80 billion. The company's revenue is unknown, although CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC that some banks are paying the company millions of dollars for its software. Regardless, $80 billion is far ahead of where any reasonable investor would value the company. Ripple has placed limitations on how much XRP it can sell each month to remove the concern that it will suddenly flood the market with tokens. The company placed 55 billion of its XRP in a ""cryptographically-secured"" escrow account and can release up to 1 billion every month. Ripple has never come close to selling that amount in a month and said in December that it's averaged selling 300 million XRP a month since mid-2016. By selling a tiny fraction of its holdings each month, the company brought in over $90 million in the first three quarters of 2017.  Ripple hasn't released its fourth-quarter XRP report yet, but if it continued selling the same amount programmatically, as a percentage of overall XRP traded, it would have raised more than $75 million in the fourth quarter and another $150 million just in the first half of January. That doesn't include money made from direct sales.  The company can dial back how much XRP it puts on the market, so there's no reason to expect that it's reeling in hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. But just having that ability puts Ripple in a cash position that's extremely rare -- particularly for a start-up with just 170 employees -- and gives it the flexibility to quickly bring in money for a pricey acquisition, fund an ambitious new project or invest in other start-ups.  Ripple executives just invested some of their XRP as part of a $25 million funding round in a storage start-up called Omni. ""In all likelihood, they need cash less than any other company on the planet,"" said Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, a crypto hedge fund in San Diego with about $70 million in assets.  Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners invested in Ripple in 2013, before the currency had any value and when the company was focused on consumer peer-to-peer payments. He doesn't have a board seat and isn't close to the company, but is suddenly looking at a potentially very valuable stake.  Figuring out exactly how to value that stake is no easy task: Lightspeed owns illiquid shares in a private company, whose soaring paper value is derived from a highly volatile asset that it plans to monetize in small chunks over the course of many years. ""It's absolutely unprecedented,"" said Liew, who's best known for his early bet on Snap. ""It hadn't been material until the end of last quarter, so now we have to think it through."" Seagate, through an investment in Ripple in 2016, could own a stake worth close to $8 billion, according to a report last week from Deep Value Research. The stock has rallied 20 percent since the report on Jan. 8, even though the company has said nothing about it publicly. While Ripple's ability to practically print money puts it in an admirable place, the start-up has attracted plenty of controversy in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that has to be mined to enter circulation and was created by a mysterious and still unidentified person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  The Ripple payment system, by contrast, is the creation of a single company that owns the majority of XRP and has control over when it hits the market.  Critics on Reddit and elsewhere comment on how crazy it is that Ripple just created a currency ""out of thin air."" Additionally, the currency is hardly being used, making it even more difficult to justify the price surge. Ripple's core product, xCurrent, is used by banks as a messaging solution that allows them to settle cross-border payments quickly. But they're not using XRP for that. A newer and still nascent Ripple product called xRapid allows financial institutions to convert fiat currencies to XRP quickly and cheaply, and transact digitally in real time.  Last week Ripple made its first significant customer announcement for xRapid. It said that MoneyGram will use the technology and XRP to speed up and reduce the cost of transferring money. Viamericas, a money transmitter focused on sending money to Latin America and Asia, said that that it's testing XRP. Ripple claims an average transaction on its network takes between two and three seconds to process. Bitcoin transactions take around 51 minutes on average, according to data by industry website Blockchain.info. ""Bitcoin showed us what's possible, but it's not going to solve every use case,"" said Garlinghouse, Ripple's CEO, who personally owns billions of dollars worth of combined Ripple equity and XRP at the current price. ""I'm personally long bitcoin, because I think it solves a problem around the store of value."" In other words, Garlinghouse sees bitcoin as a form of digital gold, attracting investors looking to diversify their holdings. But XRP has a specific use and, if he's right, it will be the way that financial firms transact over blockchain.  ""We're driving velocity and demand of XRP,"" Garlinghouse said. None of that makes it any easier to grasp the value of XRP, which helps explain the wild price swings. The best explanation for its surge is the increasing global interest in cryptocurrencies and the proliferation of online exchanges that make it possible to buy, sell and hold these types of assets.  Enneking said that for his Crypto Asset Management fund he recently shorted XRP, and he's been more bullish on bitcoin and ethereum. ""I have a tough time understanding, even if a lot of banks use Ripple to move billions of dollars, why does that increase the value of XRP?"" he said. ""I don't understand what drives price formation.""  If 2017 (and 2018 so far) has taught us anything about cryptocurrency, it's that extreme volatility is the norm. XRP could crash below 10 cents just as quickly as it soared past $3 for any number of reasons, or no reason at all. With that sort of risk, it would make sense for Ripple to maximize its monthly XRP sales and pad its cash position as much as possible. But Garlinghouse gave no indication that he's pushing in that direction. ""For everything I do, I think what is in the best interest of the XRP ecosystem,"" he said.  Correction: A previous version of this story mistakenly said GV and Andreessen Horowitz participated in the 2016 round, instead of noting that they were earlier investors. It also incorrectly said Ripple created XRP currency, but it actually started the payment system.

The digital currency had soared more than 35,500 percent in 2017 to end the year at $2.30, the website showed.  In contrast, bitcoin had climbed about 1,500 percent last year and was trading 16 percent lower for 2018, near $11,500, according to CoinDesk, as of Tuesday afternoon.  The latest ripple prices on CoinMarketCap still exclude prices from some South Korean exchanges, where ripple trades about 20 cents higher.

52,2018-01-18 05:45:00,Ripple,cnbc,Cryptocurrency prices edge higher with ripple bouncing back 65% after ‘severe’ sell-off,"Major digital currencies edged higher on Thursday, after a two-day sell-off saw the world's biggest cryptocurrency bitcoin lose more than 50 percent from its December high. Bitcoin and ethereum — the first and second largest virtual currencies by market value — appeared to recover after Wednesday's lows. Bitcoin fell as low as $9,199.59 on Wednesday morning, but bounced back to $11,702.74 as of Thursday at 12:00 p.m. ET, according to CoinDesk, which tracks prices from cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex. It was up 5 percent in the last 24 hours. The red-hot digital asset also broke the $12,000 level, hitting $12,045.10 at about 10:14 a.m. Ethereum on the other hand dived below the $800 mark to a three-week low of $780.92 Wednesday, but lifted to $1,072.57 the following day. It was more than 5 percent higher in the last 24 hours. Ripple's XRP, which is also known as ripple, surged 65 percent to $1.64 a coin, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The digital currency — which is controversial among crypto enthusiasts due the firm behind it being backed by big banks — fell as low as 90 cents the previous day. Experts told CNBC earlier this week that investors had been ""spooked"" by news of regulatory crackdowns from both South Korea and China. South Korea — one of the largest markets for cryptocurrencies — has reportedly been considering the shutdown of trading through cryptocurrency exchanges. On Thursday, the country's policymakers said they were considering closing all domestic virtual currency exchanges, echoing a move last year from Chinese regulators. China, separately, is reported to be deepening its clampdown of its digital currency market. According to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, the country is planning to ban the centralized trading of digital currencies. ""Trade volumes were very noisy yesterday as the bulls and bears fought it out and some sort of calm has appeared on the markets after what has been a severe correction,"" Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency comparison site CryptoCompare, told CNBC in an email Thursday. ""New has a lot to play with this,"" Hayter said, adding, ""this market is now big and governments are sensing revenue for the coffers as well as a threat in some degrees. This will catalyze regulation where regimes who legislate severely will balkanise themselves to the industry."" Hayter said that regulation of cryptocurrencies ""will be good in the long run,"" but warned that ""unnecessary hoops and bureaucracy"" could inhibit the industry's potential. Regulators have expressed concerns over digital assets due to their extremely volatile nature and worries that they could be used for illicit activity. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, said: ""Now that the reasons for the recent sell-off are more clear to everyone and the slightly sour regulatory concerns have been priced in and the Asian premiums are evening out, traders will most likely start focusing on the technicals."" Greenspan told CNBC Tuesday that South Korean and Japanese investors often pay a premium of ""20 percent or more per coin."" Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk, said that the sell-off was ""a feature of the global, liquid cryptocurrency trading environment."" ""When the price of bitcoin drops, there is a pattern of traders that move to take different positions, either in another cryptocurrency or in fiat,"" he told CNBC. ""These large drops, usually between the 25-40 percent range, generally find a bottom that is a consolidation of a previous all time high. When this bottom is found, the pattern continues with demand causing a new upward bounce.""

MoneyGram, based in Dallas, Texas, will use the XRP cryptocurrency to speed up and reduce the cost of transferring money through Ripple's payment network xRapid. XRP was seen surging on the news, and flew almost 15 percent higher to $2.22 at 9:55 a.m. ET, according to Coinmarketcap data. The move marked a recovery following downward pressure across most major cryptocurrencies Thursday after reports of South Korea preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading. Ripple claims an average transaction on its network takes between two and three seconds to process. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, take around 51 minutes on average to go through, according to data by industry website Blockchain.info. Ripple has made headlines in recent weeks, as its native digital currency has surged — and fallen — dramatically. It temporarily became the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value last month, usurping ethereum, after a huge rally. XRP declined significantly after that rally but Ripple said its price has not been reflected accurately, claiming that industry website Coinmarketcap's decision to remove Korean cryptocurrency exchanges from its platform has affected prices. The website removed Korean exchanges due to the ""extreme divergence"" in prices compared to the rest of the world. ""The inefficiencies of global payments don't just affect banks, they also affect institutions like MoneyGram,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement Thursday. ""Money transfer companies are incredibly important because they help people get money to their friends and loved ones."" Garlinghouse added that, by using Ripple's digital asset, MoneyGram would be able to move money ""as quickly as information.""

The financial technology start-up is the owner of XRP, the third most valuable cryptocurrency behind rivals bitcoin and ethereum, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Its distributed ledger network, RippleNet, has been joined by the likes of United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based lender RAKBANK and U.K.-based currency exchange firm IFX. It has also cleared a payments path into South America by signing up online payment provider dLocal. Blockchains are huge encrypted groupings of data dispersed across the globe that record information on digital currency transactions. People are able to exchange digital assets across these distributed ledgers without friction as they are not governed by intermediaries such as governments and central banks. Ripple hopes its latest round of financial customers will allow it to undermine the dominance of banks and corporations over financial transactions. ""The global payments industry really has been ruled by an oligopoly, led by players like JPMorgan and Citi,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC during a phone call Monday. He referred to criticisms leveled at cryptocurrencies like bitcoin by business leaders such as Jamie Dimon and Ray Dalio. ""It's certainly not that surprising to see Jamie Dimon's comments recently on bitcoin given that they (JPMorgan) control that oligopoly."" Dimon called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that will eventually ""blow up."" One of Ripple's new corporate customers, Mexican non-bank financial services firm Cuallix, will be the first institution to trial Ripple's cryptocurrency, the firm said Tuesday. Ripple claims its digital asset XRP is among the most liquid due its low transaction fees and instant payments. Banks and corporations are currently required to pre-fund local currency accounts around the world to be able to send payments quickly. By using Ripple's virtual currency, Cuallix will be able to lower the cost of payments from the U.S. to Mexico, Garlinghouse said. ""I think we're really at a tipping point for the blockchain industry,"" he said. The start-up already has interest from big-name clients including Santander, UniCredit, UBS and Standard Chartered.

Ripple's XRP coin has fallen 74 percent from an all-time high of $3.84 hit on Jan. 4, erasing $44 billion from the holdings of Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple. With XRP trading near $1 Wednesday, Larsen now holds the equivalent of just $15.8 billion, according to CNBC calculations using figures from Forbes. Citing sources at Ripple, Forbes said earlier this month that Larsen has 5.19 billion of XRP and a 17 percent stake in the start-up. Ripple holds 61.3 billion of the 100 billion XRP coins in existence. At XRP's peak on Jan. 4, Larsen was worth $59.9 billion. That made him one of the five richest people in the U.S. and wealthier than Google's founders, based on Forbes' rich list. A Ripple spokesperson had nothing to add at the time, and did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment Wednesday.  Ripple 12-month performance  Source: CoinMarketCap Major digital currencies have plunged in the last two days after reports raised concerns about increased regulation on cryptocurrencies in South Korea and China. Last week, XRP prices also appeared to fall after CoinMarketCap said it was excluding prices from certain Korean exchanges due to significant price differences with other markets.  On Wednesday, bitcoin dropped below $10,000 on CoinDesk for the first time since late November. Ethereum was close to 18 percent lower near $865, after falling through the $1,000 level Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap. With bitcoin trading near $9,870 on Wednesday, twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss' possible holdings of the digital currency have fallen to around $904 million. The brothers had a combined worth of more than $1 billion in bitcoin as the digital currency surged in December. The calculations are based on a report the brothers had $11 million in bitcoin at $120 a coin in April 2013. A representative for the twins did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The brothers may have sold or bought bitcoin since April 2013. January's price rout hardly dents cryptocurrencies' massive gains in 2017. Bitcoin soared about 1,500 percent, while XRP shot up more than 35,500 percent.  The losses may have knocked Ripple's Larsen from the five wealthiest people in America.

57,2018-01-24 14:06:00,Ripple,cnbc,"Ripple sold $91.6 million of its digital currency XRP last quarter, as the price surged almost 30,000%","Ripple, the payments company that's developing a blockchain-based system for banks, sold $91.6 million worth of digital currency XRP in the fourth quarter, taking advantage of last year's 29,631 percent price surge. Trading volume in the quarter jumped more than 35,000 percent to an average of over $807 million a day from $2.28 million in the same period a year earlier, Ripple said on Wednesday. ""XRP markets ended the year with a statement — one that will likely be remembered as a defining milestone in XRP's history,"" the company said.   For Ripple, which owns about 60 percent of all the XRP in existence, the sudden excitement for cryptocurrencies and all things blockchain has been a huge boon to the start-up's balance sheet. In total, Ripple used XRP sales to bring in over $180 million last year, without having to give up any equity in the company. That gives Ripple a significant cash cushion as it tries to sell its software to financial institutions and provides some protection in case the price of XRP crashes. It's been a wild ride so far to start 2018. After starting the year at $2.30, XRP quickly shot up to a high of $3.84 on Jan. 4, before tumbling below $1.12 days later. The currency currently sits at $1.35, which translates into about $81 billion worth of holdings for Ripple. In order to control the flow of XRP into the market, Ripple put the majority of its stake — 55 billion — into an escrow account and has the flexibility to sell up to 1 billion a month. CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC, in a story published last week, that the company has no intention of maximizing its sales to pad its cash position.  In the fourth quarter, Ripple sold $71.5 million of XRP through programmatic sales and $20.1 million directly to investors. If it sold the same percentage of total volume traded through programmatic sales this quarter as last, Ripple would have already generated over $70 million through Jan. 23, using daily volume numbers tracked by CoinMarketCap. The big test for Ripple is getting financial institutions to adopt XRP so that it's more than just a highly volatile trade. Earlier this month, the company announced that MoneyGram is using Ripple's xRapid technology and XRP currency for cross-border payments. And in a separate announcement on Wednesday, the company said that IDT Corporation and Mercury FX will use xRapid ""to settle remittances and corporate transactions quickly."" The idea is to eliminate the time it takes for payments to clear using a digital currency that's built for financial transactions. Here's how Mercury FX founder Alastair Constance described it in the statement. ""Digital assets promise fast transaction speeds but XRP is far faster than all of them, including bitcoin. Cutting settlement times from hours and days to just three seconds or less will remove billions of dollars in unnecessary intermediary fees.""

58,2017-05-26 05:11:00,Ripple,cnbc,Bitcoin rival Ripple is suddenly sitting on billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency,"Blockchain start-up Ripple is in a precarious position for a 5-year-old company. The business is still in its very early days but suddenly has billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. Ripple, which built a digital payments network for real-time financial transactions, is also the creator and biggest owner of Ripple XRP, a digital currency that has increased in value by 40 times this year. There's a total of 100 billion XRP in existence, each priced at about 26 cents. The $26 billion of total value is second among cryptocurrencies, behind bitcoin, which is valued at $41 billion. Ripple owns about 61 percent — or $16 billion worth — of XRP. If that were factored into the company's valuation, Ripple would be worth more than all but four U.S. start-ups — Uber, Airbnb, Palantir and WeWork. XRP is surging alongside bitcoin and ether as well as smaller digital currencies like dash and monero. They're all benefiting from the growing interest in blockchain, a distributed electronic ledger that makes all transactions trackable. Unlike other cryptocurrencies on the market, XRP is tied to — and majority-owned by — a single company. That's led to concern among XRP investors and enthusiasts that Ripple will one day decide to capitalize on its massive stake and flood the market with currency. Some venture investors would surely welcome cashing in on some of that value after pouring about $94 million into the company. But for people with thousands (or millions) of dollars wrapped up in XRP, the fear of a sudden excess of supply has been unsettling, particularly considering the volatility of the currency. The price fell 13 percent late in the day on Thursday and double-digit daily moves are normal.  To create some long-term stability and ease those concerns, Ripple announced a plan last week for the structured sale and use of its currency. By the end of 2017, the company will put 55 billion of its XRP into escrow and will unleash up to 1 billion into the market every month. Thus, investors will have some sense of what's coming. ""We decided to take the issue off the table,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in an interview. ""We wanted to make sure we were combating any uncertainty about supply."" Garlinghouse is a well-known name in Silicon Valley. He had senior executive roles at Yahoo and AOL and was CEO of Hightail (formerly YouSendIt) from 2012 to 2014. He joined Ripple in 2015, and earlier this year took over the CEO role from founder Chris Larsen, a serial entrepreneur, who previously started online lender Prosper.  Garlinghouse likened Ripple's situation to Yahoo, which derives almost all of its current value from its large stake in China's Alibaba. (Yahoo's core business is being sold to Verizon and the Alibaba stake is being spun out into a new holding company called Altaba.) The analogy only goes so far, as equity investors haven't ascribed a big multibillion dollar valuation to Ripple. The company last raised money in September, when the XRP currency was worth a tiny fraction of its current price. However, Ripple's business has picked up quite a bit of momentum since then, which helps explain at least some of XRP's rally. Last month, Ripple signed up 10 new financial institutions, including BBVA, to its payments platform that supports speedy transactions by eliminating all the friction that exists between various currencies and financial systems. Global banks including Bank of America, RBC and UBS are also customers. While bitcoin is the more established cyptocurrency, it's primarily used today as an investment vehicle and has run into big latency problems with handling transactions.  Ripple and ethereum have emerged as the early leaders in enabling business arrangements, with Ripple trying to build the digital payments standard for the financial sector. ""Some of those banks are all in and some are still in the early stage running a pilot,"" Garlinghouse said. ""We have real customers touching real production systems. We're the only company you can say that about in our space.""

Blockchain — otherwise known as distributed ledger technology — allows vast amounts of data to be stored on a dispersed network of computers around the world, rather than on one centralized server. It was originally used to record all bitcoin transactions but increasingly businesses are finding alternative uses for the technology, such as payments, trade finance and identity verification. A number of other financial institutions have been experimenting with distributed ledger projects, including JPMorgan, UBS, Credit Suisse, Barclays and HSBC. ""This collaboration with Ripple and Santander represents the next step forward on our blockchain journey, evolving the way we move money around the world,"" Marc Gordon, executive vice president and chief information officer at American Express, said in a statement Thursday.  American Express' blockchain project will initially allow customers in the U.S. to connect instant, traceable cross-border non-card payments to U.K. Santander bank accounts. ""This blockchain solution opens up a new channel between the U.S. and the U.K. and presents significant opportunity for payments globally"", Jose Luis Calderon, global head of global transaction banking at Santander, said in a statement Thursday. The distributed ledger platform will enable all parties involved to keep track of a transaction's status and cost. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that its blockchain network would allow the business customers of financial services firms to move money in ""real-time."" ""We're taking a huge step forward with American Express and Santander in solving the problems corporate customers experience with global payments. Transfers that used to take days will be completed in real-time, allowing money to move as fast as business today,"" Garlinghouse said in a statement Thursday. Both American Express and Santander suggested the blockchain project could eventually be extended worldwide. Ripple said that it is has tested a means of speeding up payments with its cryptocurrency, XRP, and that this would become a feature in its partnerships with banks and other financial companies further down the line. ""The XRP currency will come into play later on in the evolutionary dynamics and the other players,"" Marcus Treacher, global head of strategic accounts at Ripple, told CNBC in an interview. ""The technology we have developed, it separated a connection from the cryptocurrency or the token. So what that means is that a bank or non-bank like AMEX can use Ripple to connect and just exchange value from one fiat currency to another directly, without the need for any intermediate blockchain currency."" Some banking executives have raised concern about cryptocurrencies in recent weeks. Last month, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC he was ""not necessarily"" a believer in cryptocurrencies but that he saw a future for blockchain. Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam went as far as to describe the world's largest cryptocurrency bitcoin as ""the very definition of a bubble."" And, most notably, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has been particularly critical of bitcoin, and last month said that anyone ""stupid enough to buy bitcoin"" would ""pay the price for it one day.""

Also known as XRP, it soared to $1.24 at 1:14 a.m. ET, and was up 25 percent over a period of 24 hours, according to data from industry website Coinmarketcap. The digital currency reached the key psychological $1 mark for the first time Thursday, and hit an all-time high of $1.38 that same day. It briefly retook its place as the third-largest cryptocurrency, with a market value of $47 billion, a milestone it reached earlier this month. Ripple pared its gains later Friday morning. Its market capitalization fell bellow that of bitcoin cash, as XRP's price slid to 95 cents by 3:25 a.m. ET. Interest in alternative cryptocurrencies — known as altcoins — tends to increase when there is too much activity congesting the blockchain network underpinning bitcoin, according to experts. But major altcoins including ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin were also seen trading lower Friday. Bitcoin cash was surrounded in controversy earlier this week after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase unveiled support on its service for buying and selling the bitcoin rival. Some accused the venue of insider trading with bitcoin cash trading higher hours before the service launched its new feature. Coinbase said it is currently investigating these claims, and would ""not hesitate"" to fire employees if it finds they violated its trading policy. Meanwhile, litecoin's price fell after its creator Charlie Lee said he had sold and donated all of his holdings in the cryptocurrency. Lee said his sold stake was a ""small percentage"" of daily volume on the cryptocurrency exchange GDAX and that it ""did not crash the market."" Ripple said Thursday that its digital token was now available on  more than 50 exchanges around the world. One cryptocurrency expert pointed to talk of XRP being listed on Coinbase as a potential reason for the surge in its price. ""There are rumors on social media that XRP will be the next coin to be listed on Coinbase,"" Charles Hayter, chief executive of virtual currency comparison site Crypto Compare, told CNBC in an email. ""Litecoin and bitcoin cash experienced large volumes and price pumps on the same announcements and investors are looking to pick the next one."" XRP was created by Ripple, a blockchain firm, as a means of making international payments. The virtual coin is used to exchange high-value transactions from one fiat currency to another directly, and removes the need for fees normally associated with such transactions. The firm has said XRP transactions can be settled in four seconds. As a company, Ripple is backed by a number of big international banks and other financial institutions. Financial firms use its decentralized ledger platform, RippleNet, to make fast, cross-border payments. In November, Ripple teamed up with American Express and Santander on a blockchain pilot to speed up cross-border payments between the U.K. and U.S. In a phone interview at the time, Marcus Treacher, Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, told CNBC its virtual currency would ""come into play later"" in blockchain pilots with its financial partners.

Officially called XRP, ripple climbed 55.9 percent to a record high of $2.23 Friday afternoon, according to CoinMarketCap. The digital currency had a market cap of $86.3 billion, surpassing ethereum's $73 billion, according to the website. Earlier, the two cryptocurrencies vied for the second-place spot as prices fluctuated in morning trading.  Bitcoin remains the largest digital currency by far. It has a market capitalization of roughly $247 billion, accounting for about 41 percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap tracked by CoinMarketCap. Ripple accounted for about 12.5 percent, while ethereum was around 12.1 percent, the website showed. Six largest cryptocurrencies by market cap  Source: CoinMarketCap CoinMarketCap charts show ripple had climbed above ethereum into the second-place spot in May. But back then ripple was only worth about 36 cents. The digital currency ended 2016 at less than 1 cent and topped $1 only last week, before leaping above $2 Friday afternoon. Ripple is up more than 34,700 percent this year. Ethereum rose about 2 percent to $753.57 Friday afternoon, with a market cap of about $72.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin traded slightly higher, near $14,475, according to Coinbase. Ripple is officially the name of a San Francisco-based start-up using blockchain technology to develop a payments network for banks, digital asset exchanges and other financial institutions. Network participants use a digital coin called XRP for transactions. The cryptocurrency has a four-second settlement time, versus more than two minutes for ethereum and over an hour for bitcoin, according to Ripple's website. The company said more than 100 financial institutions use its network. In the last few weeks, some South Korean and Japanese banks have been testing Ripple's systems for cross-border payments, according to the company.  The start-up owns 61 percent of the 100 billion XRP in existence. At Friday's record high prices, that gives Ripple about $136 billion worth of the digital currency.

On Tuesday, its market cap was $231.8 billion, or around 36.1 percent of the total value of all cryptocurrencies. This is the lowest share of the market that bitcoin has had in its history. Bitcoin's previous low was 37.6 percent in June. By contrast, at the start of 2017, its market share stood at over 80 percent. Dominance refers to the percentage a single virtual currency has of the market capitalization or value of every cryptocurrency in the world. The total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency world stood at $640.4 billion on Tuesday, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin rallied by more than 1,300 percent in 2017. In December, it hit a record high of $19,783.21 before a sharp sell-off saw it plunge, closing the year at $13,889.99, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index, which tracks prices from digital currency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex. The decline of bitcoin's dominance, which on Dec. 1 stood at around 55 percent, is due to the pullback in price, but also rising interest in other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, ripple and litecoin. On Dec. 1, for example, ripple's value stood at around 3 percent of the entire market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. On Tuesday, it was over 14 percent. Ripple's price rose over 36,000 percent in 2017 and it is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Investors appear to be taking a breather from bitcoin for now and looking at alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has divided the financial and business world. Last year, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a ""fraud."" And last week, The Gartman Letter editor and publisher Dennis Gartman told CNBC that bitcoin would trade under $5,000. But many in the industry are also bullish on the cryptocurrency. Dave Chapman, managing director at cryptocurrency trading firm Octagon Strategy, sees the price of bitcoin exceeding $100,000 before the end of 2018.

It's another crytocurrency that's been rocketing in popularity lately.  While it was trading at around $0.20 a few months ago, it's now worth more than $2.25 per coin. Ripple is a little different than many other popular cryptocurrencies because it was created by a private, for-profit company that is still the biggest individual owner of the currency. But ripple isn't as easy to buy as bitcoin or other popular cryptocurrencies, since it isn't available in popular apps such as Coinbase. That means you need to jump through a few hoops to buy it. I tried several methods and think I've come up with the easiest: Only some of ripple's recommended exchanges include support for buying Ripple with the U.S. dollar, which would be the easiest way. Unfortunately, after trying several and running into technical issues or login problems, I settled on an exchange called Bitsane. (Update: Bitsane has been experiencing server overload problems. You can also try using Binance.) Setting up an account is easy, and the main page has all sorts of information on current exchange prices for trading between various cryptocurrencies. It also lets you send and receive currency from other apps, such as Coinbase, which we'll get to in a moment. Now you'll need to buy another cryptocurrency: either bitcoin or ether (the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain). It's annoying that you need to do this extra step, but unfortunately it's the easiest way to move forward. I used Coinbase to buy ether and bitcoin. It's easy to use and you can buy it using the U.S. dollar, either through a linked bank account or debit card. Follow our guide on how to buy bitcoin and ethereum for this step. In this case, I'm buying $200 worth of ether. Next, you're going to move the ether you own in Coinbase over to the Bitsane platform so you can use it to buy ripple. I know it sounds complicated, but it isn't. Do this: Now that your ether is in your Bitsane account, you can use it to buy ripple. You can see how much ripple you now own under balances. Here we can see I ended up with about 45.88 full ripple coins. Now, since I can't really spend ripple anywhere, I can just sit on it and see what happens. As with most cryptocurrencies, you're taking a bet here on whether the value is going to increase or decrease. But unlike bitcoin, you can actually buy several of these at once without spending too much money.

The digital coin jumped 29 percent to an all-time high of $3.20 in afternoon trading, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple, or XRP, now has a market capitalization of $122.7 billion and remains solidly in second place to bitcoin, which has a market value of about $251 billion, the website showed. Ripple 12-month performance  Source: CoinMarketCap The website showed ripple has gained more than 49,500 percent over the last 12 months, and more than 160 percent over the last week. Unlike bitcoin, Ripple is a company that has created coin known as XRP that is aimed at enterprises. Ripple markets itself as a cross-border payments solution for large financial institutions based on blockchain technology. Currently, an international payment may take a few days to complete, and at a high cost. A headache for banks is high-volume, but low-value, transactions — the kind that Facebook might pay out to app makers, for example. These can often be expensive and unprofitable for banks because it takes a lot of effort to move the money and the percentage cut won't be as high as for a larger transaction. Ripple is trying to solve this problem via its technology. XRP can be used by enterprises to get instant liquidity needed in a high-value transaction, without having to pay fees. XRP acts as a bridge between fiat currencies during a transaction. Ripple said transactions in XRP can be settled in four seconds, faster than any major cryptocurrency right now. Ripple has been conducting trials with a number of financial institutions, including American Express and Santander. Its price was also helped by news in December that Japan's SBI Holdings and SBI Ripple Asia, which was formed as a partnership between the two firms in 2016, created a consortium with Japanese credit card companies to utilize blockchain. Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, including Ripple. There is also a sense that investors are looking at alternative digital tokens beyond bitcoin.

Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple, has 5.19 billion of the company's digital coin XRP and a 17 percent stake in the company, according to Forbes, citing sources at Ripple.  With XRP hitting a high of $3.84 on Thursday, Larsen's holdings are worth about $59.9 billion. That puts the former Ripple CEO just ahead of Larry Ellison, who ranked fifth on Forbes 400 list with a worth of $58.4 billion. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ranks fourth, with a worth of $74.4 billion.  Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rank eighth and 10th on the list, respectively.  A representative for Ripple said the company had nothing to add. Its XRP coin soared 35,500 percent to $2.30 last year, far outpacing bitcoin's and ethereum's gains. The company owns 61.3 billion of the 100 billion XRP coins in existence, giving Ripple a market value of nearly $235.4 billion Thursday.

Ripple's website also says that the XRP coin has a four-second settlement time, versus more than two minutes for ethereum and over an hour for bitcoin.

Ripple traded near $2.98 Friday afternoon.

However, cryptocurrency enthusiasts say that centralization is the exact opposite of what the technology of the digital currencies should be about. ""The reason ripple is surging so much is it's a bubble,"" said Erik Voorhees, CEO of digital asset exchange ShapeShift and a vocal advocate for bitcoin as a way to separate money and the state. ""Testing crypto with banks doesn't make sense. The whole idea of crypto is you don't need banks."" It's ""not interesting from a financial innovation perspective,"" Voorhees said. Ripple is officially the name of a five-year-old start-up based in San Francisco that is developing a payments network for financial institutions. XRP is the name of the coin participants can use for transactions. The company announced in October that more than 100 financial institutions are using its network in some way. These include Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizhuho, Credit Agricole and Nordic bank SEB. Ripple 12-month performance  Source: CoinMarketCap In November, Ripple said American Express FX International Payments and Santander would use Ripple's network for cross-border payments between the U.S. and the U.K. Several Japanese and South Korean banks are also testing Ripple's systems for cross-border payments. If all goes well, the banks eventually plan to send money using XRP, according to a Nikkei report. ""Definitely the ripple ecosystem is definitely going to have to get a lot bigger to justify where XRP is right now,"" said Michael Graham, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who has covered internet stocks since the late 1990s. ""But clearly the use case for XRP is quite clear. That sets it apart from other crypto assets."" When asked which firms are using XRP, a Ripple representative pointed to an October announcement that said a bank called Cuallix is the first financial institution to use XRP, in this case for U.S.-Mexico transactions. No other firms were named. Cuallix has main offices in Mexico, the U.S. and Hong Kong, according to its website. ""While it's not required for banks to use XRP, as the native digital asset to the XRP Ledger it adds further value to customers in sourcing low-cost, on-demand liquidity,"" a Ripple representative said in a statement to CNBC. Bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, is up more than 25 percent this year to about $17,000, or 1,500 percent over the last 12 months, according to Coinbase. In contrast, XRP climbed 35,000 percent to $2.30 last year and has soared nearly 67 percent since to an all-time high of $3.84 on Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap. The coin remains the second largest by market cap, but fell to trade near $3 on Friday after leading U.S. digital currency marketplace Coinbase pushed back against rumors it would launch XRP trading.  ""I think a lot of retail investors think that by investing in XRP they'll be able to own a part [of the business], but they're not a stock,"" said Dan Ciotoli, software engineer and blockchain analyst at Bespoke Invest. ""I'm kind of on the side that XRP itself is not going to be used by banks,"" Ciotoli said. However, Ripple said in a tweet Thursday that 3 of the top 5 global money transfer companies plan to use XRP in payment flows in 2018. Like many of the alternatives to bitcoin that have emerged, XRP offers far faster speeds than bitcoin, which was the first application of blockchain technology when it launched nine years ago. Bitcoin transactions takes at least an hour to settle, ethereum more than 2 minutes and XRP about 4 seconds, according to Ripple's website.  All that is faster than traditional systems, which can take days. But there are fintech start-ups such as TransferWise that already allow consumers to send money overseas more quickly and cheaply than most traditional means. In a November report, Bernstein Senior Research Analyst Lisa D. Ellis said a test found using bitcoin to send money overseas was nearly 10 times more expensive than using TransferWise and also slightly slower.  CNBC reported, however, that bitcoin did prove useful for big-ticket items such as school tuition when both the buyer and seller held the digital currency.  ""One of the things we all have to remember is the value of a token over the long term is really going to be driven by its utility,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on Dec. 27 on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" ""There's no question there's a lot of hype in this system."" XRP isn't quite there yet in terms of actual usage, but then again, neither is bitcoin.

68,2018-01-02 03:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,South Korea More Than Doubled Ripple’s Price in Single Week,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   The South Korean cryptocurrency market has played a crucial role in bringing RIpple from a market cap of $40 billion to $88 billion. Analysis The South Korean cryptocurrency market accounts for a relatively small percentage of global Bitcoin trades, but has nonetheless played a crucial role in bringing RIpple’s market capitalization from $40 billion to $88 billion. Ripple was one of the best-performing crypto assets of 2017, boasting a 360x increase in value. Exactly one year ago, on January 1, 2017, a single Ripple sold just six-tenths of a cent. Today, a single token is worth $2.29. Over the past week, Ripple overtook Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency in the global market, becoming the first “altcoin” to reach a $100 billion market valuation. Many investors, especially Ethereum and Bitcoin holders, were taken aback by Ripple’s sudden surge. Analysts have attributed the recent increase in the value of Ripple to the formation of strategic partnerships between SBI Ripple Asia and South Korean banks, according to Forbes. However, the newly partnered banks will only begin processing payments on the Ripple network by the end of the first quarter of 2018. This has led some to question whether these partnerships are the real reason for Ripple’s incredible surge. One such skeptic is Ryan Selkis, entrepreneur-in-residence at Ethereum-focused Blockchain production studio ConsenSys said in an interview: ""I know of no banks that are a) using it, or b) would touch it in any way as it is controlled by a SV company and 20% of all XRP in existence were taken by the founders. The product that Ripple are offering to banks is simply a point-to-point messaging tool with some smart cryptography underneath to ensure that transactions are atomic. The liquidity model used is the same as correspondent banking. Some banks will have deep pools of liquidity available to terminate payments. Ripple's approach with XRP has been to get it listed on a bunch of exchanges and ‘infer' but never explicitly say that banks are using it for settlement.” The claim that no banks are using the Ripple network to process payments is not entirely accurate. Earlier this year, major Swedish bank SEB settled $180 million on the Ripple Blockchain network by sending cross-border payments on behalf of high profile clients. Banks in Thailand and Japan have also been processing near-instantaneous transactions for many months using Ripple. However, it is true that no major banks are utilizing the Ripple Blockchain network on a daily basis to process large volumes of transactions. Tony Lyu, the founder and CEO of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit, told the New York Times that the South Korean market is heavily driven by FOMO, or fear of missing out. Lyu said: “Word just spreads really fast in Korea. Once people are invested, they want everyone else to join the party. There’s been this huge, almost a community movement around this.” Over the past week, the South Korean market and its largest cryptocurrency exchanges including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit have accounted for more than half of Ripple’s $4.5 bln daily trading volume. South Koreans continue to pay a premium for their digital currency. On Bithumb, for instance, Ripple is being traded at $2.54, nearly 24 percent higher than the global average price.  Caption: Price of Ripple and other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb Speculation and cryptocurrency mania in the South Korean market have become a major concern for the government policy makers. South Korean financial authorities have prohibited foreigners and underaged investors from investing in cryptocurrencies in an effort to bring the speculation under control.

69,2018-01-02 19:00:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan.2","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Bullish market? Let’s see.   The cryptocurrency mania can be gauged from the fact that Bitcoin, with its 1300 percent plus gains, doesn’t find a place among the top 10 best performing cryptocurrencies of 2017. The top performer was Ripple, with more than astounding 30,000 percent increase over a year. In comparison, the traditional investors consider themselves lucky if they outperform the S&P 500, which rallied 20 percent last year. While no one can predict what will happen in 2018, one thing is certain; if the traders can spot the setups, they can reap a rich reward. As we already saw both cryptocurrencies rallying collectively and them going separate ways, it might be a good idea to diversify your portfolio with more than one cryptocurrency. Our attempt should be to trade the best setups that can offer us the maximum profits with the minimum risk. So, let’s find out the probable candidates to buy this week. Bitcoin is finding strong buying support at the 50-day SMA; but, unlike before, it is not able to pullback with strength. The bears are strongly defending the $14,000 levels. The daily range has been shrinking for the past two days.  On Dec. 30, though the BTC/USD pair broke below the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern, it could not break below the 50-day SMA. It quickly climbed back above the neckline on the next day. The bulls are finding it difficult to break out of the overhead resistance from the down trendline and the 20-day EMA; and we don’t find any buy setup between $12,000 and $14,000. Still, Bitcoin is likely to rally to $16,000, once the cryptocurrency breaks out of the down trendline. On the other hand, if it breaks down of $12,000, it can retest the lows made on Dec. 22. We expect a large range move within the next couple of days. We had mentioned that the digital currency will gain strength once it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line and that is what happened.  The ETH/USD pair broke out of the downtrend line on December 31 and crossed the overhead resistance of $760 on January 01. Thereafter, it picked up momentum and has created a new lifetime high today. If the bulls manage to sustain above $863, we can expect a rally to $973 levels, which is the next Fibonacci extension target. The resistance line of the ascending channel is also at this level. Therefore, we expect this level to offer a strong resistance. On the downside, if the bulls fail to sustain above $863, the trendline of the channel close to the $760 mark, will act as a strong support. We expected Bitcoin Cash to plunge to the 50-day SMA, once it broke below the $2,300 mark. Instead, it took support at the trendline and is attempting a recovery.     If the BCH/USD pair sustains above $2,475, it should attempt a rally to $2,900 levels, which is a major resistance. Any fall is likely to be supported at the trendline and if it breaks, the next support is at $2,072. However, the risk to reward ratio is not attractive, hence, we don’t recommend any trade on it right now.     The correction in Ripple was short lived as the buyers jumped in at the $1.61 mark; it shows strength.  For the past two days, the XRP/USD pair had been facing resistance at the $2.1 mark. Today, the bulls broke out of the resistance, which can push the pair to $2.474 levels. We already saw the cryptocurrency consolidating for six to seven days, before resuming its uptrend. Thus, we anticipate a few more days of consolidation before the price breaks out to new lifetime highs. On the downside, $1.8 and $1.6 are the two critical support levels. The momentum loses strength only when it breaks down to $1.6.   We had indicated in our previous analysis that long positions can be initiated on a breakout and close above the downtrend line.  As the bears were unable to sustain below the critical support level of $3.032 for the past few days, chances are that the bulls will attempt to push the price towards the upper end of the range at $5.59. Therefore, traders who haven’t initiated a long position yet can still do at the current levels of $4.121, with a stop loss of $2.85. We are aiming to trade the large range by buying close to the support and selling at the resistance. We await  IOTA/USD pair to be volatile but with a positive bias.    The bears had the upper hand on Dec. 30, with a break of the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. But the bulls supported Litecoin around the $200 mark.  Currently, the LTC/USD pair has broken out of the downtrend line, the neckline and the 20-day EMA. This is a positive move. Above $250, a move to $283 and thereafter to $300 is likely. On the downside, strong support exists at $200 and below this at $175, from the 50-day SMA. As this is still a pullback, we don’t suggest a trade on it. We expected the trendline support to hold and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency fell to the trendline on Dec. 30. However, the bounce from the support has been impressive.    We believe that the DASH/USD pair can now rally to $1,220 levels, where it is likely to face some resistance. On the other hand, any fall will find support at the trendline. Since the risk to reward ratio does not look good, we are not suggesting any trade. Cardano remained in a range from Oct. 01 to Nov. 25. Thereafter, it rallied for four days and again became range-bound until Dec. 14. It then spiked again in the next five days from $0.135375 to $0.581983. Subsequently, it entered into a correction, which ended around the $0.37 levels.    The latest leg of the up move started on Dec. 28 and it has crossed its first target objective of $0.75. The previous rallies lasted for around four to five days. Hence, we anticipate a pullback around the current levels, which should be a good buying opportunity, as the cryptocurrency remains in a strong uptrend. Any pullback should find strong support at $0.68 and $0.60 levels. The market data is provided by TradingView.

At press time, the altcoin was trading at an average of $3.12. Ripple’s price has increased almost 49,000 percent over the past twelve months. The cryptocurrency passed $2 just last week, seeing a 130% increase since Dec 27. This has cemented Ripple’s number two position with a market cap of $121 bln, almost half that of Bitcoin.  Ripple markets itself as a Blockchain-based payment solution for enterprise level global payment transactions. The addition of the coin on Bloomberg's price terminal in mid-December arguably started the substantial rally. A recent “cryptocurrency mania” on South Korean market, during which almost half of Ripple trading volumes occurred several multiple exchanges in the country, has also contributed to the altcoin’s rise. Investors and cryptocurrency believers have been pursuing other altcoins recently as well, creating substantial gains in the top 30. The most notable gains include Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (XLM), which have both jumped more than 30% on the day, as well as Status (SNT), which saw an over 100 percent increase in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, on Jan. 3 BTC dominance (percentage of total market capitalization) hit a new record low of 34.6 percent.

71,2018-01-04 18:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 04","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   With Bitcoin losing its market value to altcoins, let’s see what orders to place.   While China banned initial coin offering (ICO) back in September 2017, it has not prevented the Chinese social network Renren from seeking an ICO. The company’s stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange climbed 47.39 percent to $18.32 a share following the news. Similarly, Israeli trading company Plus500 saw its stock price spike 20 percent as it reported that cryptocurrency trading had boosted its profits. This shows that the markets are excited about the companies getting involved with the Blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies. But not regulators, apparently. The Israel Securities Authority, for example, is not in favor of stocks, whose main business is linked to cryptocurrencies. The regulator plans to prohibit the listing of shares of such companies. Will other stock markets regulators also follow? Difficult to say. As the cryptocurrencies market cap has crossed over the $760 bln point with altcoins outperforming Bitcoin, let’s see if we can identify any buy or sell patterns today. Though Bitcoin broke out of the downtrend line, it did not reach our expected target objective of $16,000. Failure of the bulls to capitalize on the breakout of the downtrend line is a bearish sign.  We find a symmetrical triangle developing, which is a continuation pattern. The cryptocurrency is currently retesting the breakout levels of the triangle. If it holds the $14,000 levels and reverses direction, we suggest long positions above $15,500. If the BTC/USD pair falls below $14,000, it is likely to fall to the neckline and below that to the trendline of the triangle. A breakdown of $12,000 levels will be negative, which can extend the fall to $8,000 levels. Therefore, traders should keep a stop loss around $13,500 once their long positions are triggered. Also, avoid buying below the specified levels. We expected a move to $973, once Ethereum sustained above $863 and it has reached our target objective today.    The resistance line of the channel is likely to act as strong resistance. Based on the previous experience, we find that once the cryptocurrencies are in a momentum, they overshoot their target objectives. Therefore, traders can book partial profits at the resistance line and hold the rest with a close stop-loss because if the ETH/USD pair breaks out of the ascending channel, it can rally to $1,200 levels. However, the markets can turn down in a jiffy, so make sure to trail the stops higher instead of being fixated on the targets. Though Bitcoin Cash broke out of $2,475, it could not reach $2,900 levels, as we had expected. It turned back from $2,770.6933.      The cryptocurrency has again fallen to the critical trendline support, which has provided support on two previous occasions. If this level breaks, there is marginal support at the $2,072.6853 point; below that a fall to $1,733.3558 is likely. If the trendline support holds, we may see another attempt by the bulls to push the  BCH/USD pair higher. The pair is likely to gain momentum above $2,800 levels.     Ripple did not waste any time in consolidation, as we had anticipated. It just broke out to new lifetime highs yesterday and has continued higher.  With this rally, the pair has risen from a low of $0.22255 on December 11 to a high of $3.317 today. That is a 1,390 percent rally within a month. It is difficult to project a target when an asset class is backed by such a strong momentum. However, as a reference, the next target on the XRP/USD pair is $3.414 and above it $3.90469. Nevertheless, even at the risk of missing out on a further rally, we believe that the traders should book about 50% profits at the current levels and hold the rest with a close stop loss. The cryptocurrency is clearly overbought and is due for a correction or a consolidation shortly.    We have recommended long positions on IOTA in our two previous analyses. We expect the bulls to attempt a rally towards the upper end of the range at $5.59.  The bears are defending the overhead resistance of $4.34. Currently, the IOTA/USD pair is taking support at the 20-day EMA. If this level breaks, it is likely to retest the lows at $3.03 levels. The cryptocurrency pair will gain momentum only above $4.34 levels. Since IOTA is still inside the range, we recommend holding to the long position with a stop loss of $2.85. We shall reconsider our position in a couple of days.    The pullback in Litecoin could not sustain above the $250 levels. The cryptocurrency has again broken below the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern.  It has again broken below the 20-day EMA, which has flattened out. Still, we find buying on dips, closer to the $200 levels. The LTC/USD pair has support at $195.417, below that at $179.7308 from the 50-day SMA, and finally at $175.199, which is the lows formed on December 22. If the cryptocurrency pair doesn’t break out of $260 within a couple of days, we expect it to resume its slide towards the lower targets. NEM has climbed from a low of $0.23595 on December 08 to a high of $2.06278 today, which is a 774 percent rally within a month. It has climbed to the sixth position in terms of market capitalization. Hence, we included it in our analysis.    The XEM/USD pair has risen vertically over the past three days. It has a target objective of $2.13774, which is a critical Fibonacci extension level. We expect some resistance at this overhead resistance. Therefore, traders should keep a close stop-loss on their position. It does not necessarily mean that the cryptocurrency will crash from $2.13774 levels. It can consolidate for a few days and then again resume its uptrend. In a correction, we expect support at $1.57849 and $1.42889, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent leg of the up move from $0.794 to $2.06278.   As we don’t have the charts with enough data available for ADA/USD, we are analyzing the ADA/BTC pair. We expected Cardano to correct in our previous analysis; however, it extended its rally in the past two days and proved us wrong.  From a low of 0.00000338 on Nov. 25 to a high of 0.00009180, today, the ADA/BTC pair has risen 2,615 percent in one and half months. This shows that it is in a strong momentum. Though momentum can carry it higher, the rally is overextended and is likely to enter into a consolidation or correction soon. Therefore, traders should book partial profits on every rise and should keep a close stop loss on their remaining position. It is difficult to call a top, but the risk to reward is skewed to the downside. The market data is provided by TradingView.

72,2018-01-05 03:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Coinbase Rejects Ripple Integration Rumors, Currency’s Market Cap Drops $22 Billion","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Coinbase has refuted recent rumors that Ripple (XRP) will be integrated into GDAX, its flagship digital currency exchange. Analysis The popular exchange and wallet platform Coinbase has refuted recent rumors that Ripple (XRP) or other cryptocurrencies will soon be integrated into GDAX, its flagship digital currency exchange. CEO Brian Armstrong firmly stated that neither Coinbase and GDAX have made a decision to integrate any cryptocurrency or digital asset in the short-term. The company said in a blog post: “A committee of internal experts is responsible for determining whether and when new assets will be added to the platform in accordance with our framework. These individuals — and all employees at Coinbase — are subject to confidentiality and trading restrictions. As of the date of this statement, we have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company.” Coinbase’s statement was released following a spate of unverified rumors that claimed GDAX is planning to integrate XRP. The scale of the rumors, which largely circulated on Reddit and Twitter, increased to the point where the company felt the need to refute them, as the price of XRP surged. Immediately after Coinbase issued its statement, the market valuation of XRP decreased from over $148 billion to $126 billion.  Coinbase and GDAX are unlikely to integrate any new assets until they can be certain to prevent any leaks. In early December, when Coinbase added Bitcoin Cash, a Coinbase employee or a contractor reportedly revealed the integration two days prior to the official announcement. Coinbase received significant backlash and criticism from the cryptocurrency community and as a consequence, Armstrong vowed to launch a full investigation. The CEO stated that Coinbase will pursue legal action against the employee or contractor that released confidential information on the company’s digital asset integration plans. As such, the recent statement of Armstrong and rumors around Coinbase’s Ripple integration were also criticized by some of the community’s most prominent experts. These include BitGo lead engineer Jameson Lopp, who tweeted: We haven't made any decisions to add new assets to Coinbase or GDAX at this time. Any statement to the contrary is untrue. Be careful what you believe out there! https://t.co/1yUYG33AoG The investigation into the Bitcoin Cash controversy is still ongoing and until that is completed, it is highly unlikely that Coinbase will pursue the implementation of other cryptocurrencies. The company’s CEO admitted that some insider trading-like movement was spotted in the global Bitcoin Cash exchange market prior to the listing of Coinbase. On December 20, Armstrong wrote: “Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter. If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies — directly or indirectly — I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.” Former Coinbase executive Charlie Lee also stated: “Coinbase is not adding a new coin anytime soon. There's no reason why they would lie about this... Especially after the flack they got for surprising everyone by adding BCH.”   ",https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-rejects-ripple-integration-rumors-currencys-market-cap-drops-22-billion,0.391304347826087,0.0,0,-1

Brief Ripple Chairman and Co-founder Chris Larsen has profited so much from the asset’s bull run he could be the world’s richest person. That’s according to BitFury CEO George Kikvadze, whose made a tweet about Larsen’s likely huge personal wealth gains over the past year. “At Ripple's Implied Market Value of $320 bln - Chris Larsen with his 37 percent stake has become the world's richest person bypassing (Bill Gates) & (Warren Buffett),” Kikvadze noted Wednesday. BREAKING: At RIPPLE'S Implied Market Value of $320Bln - Chris Larsen with his 37% stake has become the world's richest person bypassing @BillGates & @WarrenBuffett !!! @CNBC @business @Forbes CONGRATS CHRIS ! Ripple’s XRP token has delighted investors into 2018 with gains of over 35,000 percent, much of that taking place in the last few months. Shooting up to highs above $3.60 per token, only Coinbase’s announcement that it had “no plans” to add new assets, including XRP, was able to take prices down somewhat. On the topic of Larsen meanwhile, Forbes gave a more conservative outlook, nonetheless placing the co-founder’s wealth at up to $59 bln. “That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people,” the New York Times commented on the data. Zuckerberg had coincidentally hinted at plans to integrate cryptocurrency with unnamed Facebook “services” this week, announcing in a post that he was “interested in going deeper and studying the positive and negative aspects of [technologies like encryption and cryptocurrencies], and how best to use them.”   ",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-success-tips-chairman-for-worlds-richest-as-zuckerberg-eyes-crypto,0.9090909090909092,0.0,1,0
74,2018-01-06 18:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan. 06: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   With the market capitalization getting close to $1 tln point, what orders shall we place?   Most traditional investors have stayed away from Bitcoin citing its volatility. Yet, this has not stopped Direxion Asset Management LLC from planning to list “leveraged” and “inverse” funds that will rise or fall twice as fast as the Bitcoin price. Nevertheless, the big question is whether the US securities regulators will give the nod to such an instrument. Any ETF acceptance is likely to give a big boost to cryptocurrencies. With the market capitalization of the crypto universe inching towards the $1 tln mark, let’s see what kind of trading moves might seem suitable. We had suggested initiating long positions in Bitcoin at $15,500 in our previous analysis. The level was reached yesterday, Jan. 5, which triggered the long position. Subsequently, the price broke out of the resistance at $16,500 and rallied to a high of $17,083.67, where it witnessed profit booking.  Currently, the cryptocurrency is in a pullback. It is likely to find support at the $15,500 mark that had served as resistance earlier. The trendline support is also at the same level. The BTC/USD pair is still not out of the woods. If it returns from the current levels and breaks the neckline at $13,000, it will complete a complex head and shoulders pattern, which will be a bearish sign. Therefore, we recommend keeping a stop loss of $15,000 in our positions. It’ll reduce our risk.   On the upside, we expect a rally to $19,000 levels if Bitcoin sustains above $17,000. But traders should trail their stops higher as the trade moves in their favor. For the past two days, Jan.4-5, Ethereum has been facing profit booking at the resistance line of the ascending channel.     It has not given up any ground, which shows buying strength at lower levels. We anticipate another attempt by the bulls to break out of the channel. If successful, the ETH/USD pair can climb to $1,200 levels and thereafter to $1,310. In case the bulls fail to break out of the ascending channel, a fall to the lower end of the channel at $840 is likely. That’s why we believe partial profits should be taken between $1,000 and $1,040 levels. Rest of the positions can be held with a close stop loss depending on the strategy of the trader. Though Bitcoin Cash broke below the trendline, it held on to the $2,291 levels that has provided support for four days in a row.  For the past two days, the cryptocurrency has been trading in a tight range of $2,991 - $2,553.18. If the bulls break out and sustain above $2,555, a move to $2,800 and thereafter to $2,900 is likely. But if the support breaks, the BCH/USD pair is likely to extend its fall to $2,072.6853. We don’t have a clear buy set up, so we are not recommending any trade.     Ripple is currently in a pullback after reaching a high of $3.317 on Jan. 04. However, the fall to $2.15 levels yesterday, Jan.5, was bought aggressively. In the near term, this is a critical support point, below which the correction is likely to extend to $1.76 levels.  In order to understand whether the traders should expect a further rally or a correction, we have gone back to the start of the year using a log scale. Ripple has a history of sharp rallies, which are followed by a period of correction/consolidation. The first up move from March 2 to April 2 of this year saw about 1,100 percent rise. The second rally from April 25 to May 17 resulted in 1,183 percent gain. The most recent rally from Dec. 11 to Jan. 4 led to 1,390 percent growth. We find that the duration of the up move and the quantum of the rally is almost similar in all the three instances. So there might be a chance the XRP/USD pair has just formed a short-term top. Both the previous corrections found support at about 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. If history repeats itself, we are likely to see a fall to $1.40 levels. However, this is not an exact science and the above-mentioned projections will be invalidated if Ripple breaks out and sustains above $3.317.      IOTA has been trading inside the $3.032 - $5.59 range since Dec. 06. Traders who follow us would have taken long positions at $3.904. For people who missed buying at those levels, we had suggested a buy at $4.121.  As the bears failed to break down of the range, we expect the bulls to attempt to rally to the upper end of the range. Currently, the IOTA/USD pair is taking support at the 20-day EMA but is facing resistance at $4.34 levels. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the overhead resistance, a rally to $5.59 is likely. However, if the bears push the cryptocurrency below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to $3.03 levels. We suggest holding the long positions with a stop-loss of $2.85.     The bears could not capitalize on the neckline breakdown of the head and shoulders pattern on two occasions.  As a result, the bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend. But we expect profit booking at higher levels as the LTC/USD pair climbs to the lifetime highs. The cryptocurrency will become negative only on a breakdown below $175. We expect Litecoin to trade in a range for the next few days. Currently, we don’t find any reliable setups, hence, we are not anticipating any trade on it. We expected NEM to face resistance at $2.13774 levels and it returned from $2.06278. The cryptocurrency corrected close to $1.42889, which is 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally from $0.795 to $2.06278.  If the $1.4 level holds, we expect the bulls to attempt to resume the uptrend once again. Therefore, aggressive traders can buy at $1.702 and keep a stop loss of $1.4. Our target objective is a retest of the highs. However, this is a risky trade and should be attempted only with about 25 percent of the usual allocation. Risk-averse traders should wait for a set up with a better risk to reward ratio because if $1.4 level breaks, the XEM/USD pair is likely to fall to the trendline support.   We had recommended traders to book profits and trade with a close stop loss. The ADA/BTC pair topped out on Jan. 4 at 0.00009180.  The pullback is finding support at the 0.000053 levels, which is just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 0.00002539 to 0.00009180. If the levels hold, we may see an attempt by the bulls to resume the uptrend. However, we expect to see profit booking at higher levels. We await a range bound move in ADA/BTC for the next few days.

Brief US mainstream media network CNBC has caused a stir after airing a step-by-step tutorial on how to buy Ripple on Poloniex. In what would previously have been an unlikely format for the broadcaster, host Brian Kelly used screens of the Poloniex order book to guide consumers through the process of specifically acquiring Ripple’s XRP token. He then performed a live spot trade in which he converted around three BTC to XRP. “I’ve bought all that Ripple - that’s how easy and fast it is,” Kelly commented.

In December, the sudden appearance of pro-Bitcoin Cash content both on air and on social media accounts raised significant suspicions from the cryptocurrency community. XRP’s astronomical price rise has meanwhile likewise given rise to concerns from those unconvinced by the utility of the token versus the platform itself. Ripple businesses are not required to invest in XRP. Nonetheless, CEO Brad Garlinghouse remains adamant its use as a currency will deal a blow to Bitcoin, a perspective mainstream publications other than CNBC have since jumped on. “A lot for the speculation that’s gone on about XRP lately is people realizing Bitcoin is not going to be the kind of panacea of all things Blockchain we once thought it would be,” Garlinghouse told NBC. “Instead you’re having vertical specific.

76,2018-01-08 18:05:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Cryptocurrency Market Takes a Tumble as Ripple Bubble Fear Looms,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   The top 16 cryptocurrencies have all plunged between three and 39 percent today as altcoin bubble fears loom and Bitcoin feels the pinch. Analysis 2018 did not begin on a good note for Bitcoin as the monster rally leading to Christmas crashed, but it made a bit of a recovery in and among a boom for a number of altcoins. However, Monday has not been a good day for the entire cryptocurrency market. Looking down the graphs of the top cryptocurrencies, you’d be hard-pressed to find one in the black as all of the top 10 coins hit a downward trend, led by Ripple which had dropped by almost 28 percent over the last 24 hours. Coinmarketcap showed some unpleasant numbers for all top 10 coins as Bitcoin was registered as being down 11 percent, Ripple down 28 percent and Bitcoin Cash down 20 percent.  Ripple’s losses were by and far the biggest, especially considering the growth the coin experienced in the past few weeks. Ripple reached $3 a coin a few days ago after it was added to Bloomberg’s price terminal in late December. South Korea also recently pushed up the altcoin market as the mania strike the Asian country with Ripple’s doubling up attributed to South Korea being taken with the Blockchain-based payment solution for enterprise-level global payment transactions. The low Ripple numbers may be down to the fact that Coinmarketcap does not including information from some South Korean exchanges, but there are other concerns afoot. ""The reason ripple is surging so much is it's a bubble,"" said Erik Voorhees, CEO of digital asset exchange ShapeShift and a vocal advocate for Bitcoin as a way to separate money and the state. ""Testing crypto with banks doesn't make sense. The whole idea of crypto is you don't need a bank.” The technology behind Ripple is aimed at large institutions, which has given it an air of legitimacy which in turn has spurred the price and build a hype for investors. However, cryptocurrency enthusiasts say that centralization is the exact opposite of what the technology of the digital currencies should be about. Many saw the recent dip in Bitcoin’s dominance as the reemergence of altcoins, with Ripple, and even other minor coins like Verge stealing the limelight. However, this recent dip seems to suggest that there are still strong ties between many coins to the dominant force that is Bitcoin. The adage goes that: 'A rising tide lifts all boats,' and the same goes for a falling one. With Bitcoin still being the biggest boat in the bay, it makes sense that should an issue affect it and its price, other coins in the crypto market will also feel the effect. Famed stock picker Ronnie Moas recently predicted that there would be a reverse on this so-called ‘altcoin season,’ and perhaps, this is it as everyone goes down before the most established digital currency again rises up.

77,2018-01-08 20:50:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 8","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Latest price review and trading suggestions.   After a bumper 2017, the cryptocurrency market is attracting new traders who wish to make a fortune in short time. While this is a bullish development, it is also fraught with risk. Most newbies entering the markets believe that it is a ‘get rich quick’ scheme. However, a majority will end up investing in coins that are likely to vanish from the scene in a few years. Too many inexperienced traders willing to buy at any price can lead to a bubble, which will end with a sharp downturn that does not bounce back quickly. Hope, we are smart enough to identify the bear market beforehand and emerge with minimum losses. Traders should always keep an eye on the risk so that they can last in this business for the long-term.   Bitcoin could not sustain above $17,000 levels, which encouraged profit booking and selling at the higher levels. It has broken below the 20-day EMA and the trendline support, hitting our trailing stop loss at $15,000. If the bears can sustain below $15,000, the cryptocurrency will become negative and extend its fall to $14,000. Below this level, the 50-day SMA is the last major support, which has not been broken convincingly since end-September. Therefore, if the bears succeed in sustaining below the 50-day SMA, it will indicate weakness. The head and shoulders pattern is still intact and if the price breaks below the neckline, traders should brace themselves for lower levels, even below $10,000. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair takes support and turns around from any of the above-mentioned support levels and breaks out of $17,200 levels. Ethereum broke out of the ascending channel yesterday, Jan. 7, and rose to $1,191 levels, where it witnessed profit booking. We had mentioned $1,200 as one of the possible targets in our previous analysis. If bulls manage to break out of $1,200, the next target on the upside is $1,310, which is arrived at by adding the width of the channel to the breakout point of the channel.   However, currently, the price has turned down and has entered into the channel once again, which is a negative sign. Levels that can offer support are $993.91 and $933.03, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent retracement levels of the latest leg of the rally. If the bulls fail to propel the ETH/USD pair back above the channel quickly, we most likely see a fall to $820, which is the trendline support of the channel increase. Bitcoin Cash could not break out of the $2,800 levels yesterday, Jan. 7. As a result, it has now formed a range between $2,291 and $2,770.6933. The lower end of the range has held on four occasions. If it holds again, we are likely to witness a few more days of range-bound trading. But if the range breaks down, it is likely to attract further selling, which can sink the BCH/USD pair to the 50-day SMA, close to $2,000.     For the past three days, Ripple has been trading inside the large range formed on Jan. 5. The support on the downside is between $2.13492, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, and $2.15777, the low on Jan. 5. On the upside, resistance lies at $2.849, $3.06 and $3.317. As mentioned earlier, we expect the XRP/USD pair to fall to about $1.4 levels eventually and remain range bound for the next few days. It’ll prove to be wrong if the price breaks out to new lifetime highs.      On Jan. 7, IOTA again failed to sustain above the overhead resistance at $4.34. We hold long positions initiated at $3.904 and $4.121. As the bulls have failed to sustain above $4.34 on three occasions, we believe that the bears are likely to push the cryptocurrency down to the lower end of the range. Our current suggested stop loss is at $2.85. Although considering the weakness in Bitcoin and most other top currencies, we recommend raising our stop loss to $3.5. We shall initiate long positions again when the IOTA/USD pair falls to the bottom of the range at $3.032.     The attempts by the bulls to resume the uptrend in Litecoin hit a wall on Jan. 6, at $307.992. After the stellar rally from $84.708 to $370, the cryptocurrency has entered a period of correction/consolidation and has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern.   A breakout from the triangle and the overhead resistance at $307.992 is likely to resume the uptrend in the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a breakdown from the triangle will be bearish, which can result in a sharp fall if the price breaks below $175.199. As long as the LTC/USD pair trades inside the triangle, it is likely to remain volatile and trendless. We had recommended a long position at $1.072 expecting a retest of the highs. Yet, NEM could only reach a high of $1.9. Like all other cryptocurrencies, the XEM/USD pair has also turned down sharply. It is likely to break below our stop loss of $1.4 and fall towards the trendline. If the trendline support breaks, a fall to $0.795 is likely.    On the upside, the bulls will face a stiff resistance between $1.9 and the lifetime highs. After the large range day on Jan. 5, Cardano remained in a small range on Jan. 6 and Jan.7. Today, the cryptocurrency has turned down. Its immediate support is at 0.00005347, which is the low reached Jan. 5. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to the 20-day EMA. However, if the ADA/BTC pair holds the support levels, we may see another attempt to resume the uptrend. Any long positions should only be initiated once the price breaks out of 0.00006655.

78,2018-01-09 19:37:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"CoinMarketCap Removes South Korea Exchanges, Ripple Market Cap Drops $20 Billion","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Major South Korean exchanges were excluded from CoinMarketCap’s price calculations, Ripple prices drop almost 30% in a day Brief Highly popular cryptocurrency price tracker CoinMarketCap removed several South Korean exchanges from its listings on Jan. 8, causing a dip in the overall market that particularly affected altcoin Ripple (XRP). The exchanges removed include Bithumb, the world’s second largest exchange in terms of trading volume, along with Coinone and Korbit. CoinMarketCap, which uses data from multiple major global exchanges to produce averaged prices for cryptocurrencies, tweeted Monday about their decision to remove the exchanges, saying that it was due to “the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity.” This morning we excluded some Korean exchanges in price calculations due to the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity. We are working on better tools to provide users with the averages that are most relevant to them. CoinMarketCap’s decision was followed by a dramatic reverse in Ripple’s record-breaking uptrend. The day CoinMarketCap removed the South Korean exchanges, Ripple saw an immediate loss of over $20 bln in market capitalization, and an almost 30 percent price drop Jan. 8. The altcoin was overtaken by Ethereum (ETH) as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ripple in particular is traded on South Korean exchanges at very high volumes, a fact which reportedly helped bring Ripple to second place on the crypto market just last week. Prices on South Korean exchanges are also over a dollar higher than on most other exchanges globally, which is part of what prompted CoinMarketCap to exclude them.  Rumors that Coinbase would add the altcoin, followed by confirmation on Jan. 4 that it would not, caused a peak and drop in Ripple’s price in the first few days of January. However the price drop after CoinMarketCap’s Jan. 8 decision had a more immediate and drastic effect, with an over 16 percent drop in the space of 6 minutes.  As a result of the move, XRP is currently trailing by some $0.60 on CoinMarketCap versus similar services such as Live Coin Watch, which still includes the major Korean exchanges. Users on Twitter complained that CoinMarketCap’s failure to promptly alert users about their decision caused panic selling that in turn aggravated the market drop. Coinmarketcap's decision to exclude Korean prices from the displayed XRP price made the price appear to drop, likely triggering some panic selling. Look closely at the data and don't be mislead. On Jan. 7 local media in South Korea reported that authorities will inspect six of the country’s major banks to probe for money laundering via cryptocurrency.

79,2018-01-11 00:35:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan.10: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   With Blockchain becoming a buzzword for the traditional finances, will the market boom again?   On Jan 9, the photography giant Kodak announced a launch of its cryptocurrency KodakCoin scheduled by the end of the month. This news led to a spike in Kodak stock prices. Yet it’s unpredictable whether it will boost the company’s capitalization, but at least the company has been quick in adopting the technology of the future. The jump in Kodak’s stock prices points to the crypto craze infecting even traditional investors. In the past few days, they have lapped up stocks of the companies that have connected with Blockchain or cryptocurrency. Even JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in a recent exclusive interview to Fox Business, stated that he regrets calling Bitcoin a fraud.   As traders, our interest is to buy the cryptocurrencies that will offer us maximum profits. Let’s see if we can find out any buy setups. On Jan. 8, though the bulls purchased the fall to the 50-day SMA, they could not capitalize on the gains. Recovery attempts faced resistance at the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. As a result, Bitcoin has again fallen to the 50-day SMA. Bitcoin is currently trading at critical support levels, where it has support from the 50-day SMA, the trendline support of the symmetrical triangle and the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. If this support holds, the cryptocurrency is likely to continue to trade inside the symmetrical triangle. But if the price breaks down of this critical support zone, a fall to $8,000 is likely, with minor support at $10,705 levels. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair turns up and breaks above the $17,200 level. But we think there are small chances of that happening. Ethereum has broken above $1,310 levels, which was the target objective as mentioned in our previous analysis.    We believe that the cryptocurrency will find it difficult to break out of the overhead resistance zone between $1,310 and $1,434. Therefore, traders who have entered long positions at lower levels can book partial profits in this resistance zone. We expect the ETH/USD pair to enter a period of correction/consolidation for the next few days. In a drop, the resistance line of the ascending channel will be the first support. If this holds, we can expect a few days of range-bound trading. Still, we can see a fall to the 20-day EMA if the bears succeed in pushing prices back into the channel. Bitcoin Cash continues to trade in the $2,291 - $2,770 range. The attempt to break down failed on Jan. 8. Currently, the cryptocurrency has strong buying support. In case the price breaks out of the upper end of the range, it may move to $3,249. Above this level, a retest of the highs is also possible. However, if the bulls fail to do that and sustain above the range, range bound action is likely to continue for a few more days. Trading will be volatile inside this range. The next trend will start once the BCH/USD pair breaks out or breaks down. On the downside, the $2,000 to $2,291 support zone is important, because if it breaks, a slide to $1,733 and thereafter to $1,200 is likely.     We had predicted a fall to $1.40 levels on Ripple on Jan. 6 and today, Jan. 10, the price touched a low of $1.61, which is close to our projected levels. The bulls are trying to defend the uptrend line and the 20-day EMA. After more than 50 percent correction within a week, we may see an attempt to bounce. However, we believe that any recovery will face stiff resistance between $2.46 and $2.80. If the bulls are unsuccessful in holding the trendline support, a slide to $1.40 is possible, which should hold. We expect a few days of the range bound action in the XRP/USD pair.      In the medium term, IOTA is range bound between $3.03 and $5.59. However, in the short term, the range has shrunk to $3.03-$4.34. The lower end of the range has held for more than a month. Therefore, we believe that the bulls will continue to defend this level and the cryptocurrency will gradually recover to $4.34 and thereafter to $5.59 levels. The IOTA/USD pair might become bearish and slide towards $1.70 if this level breaks. But it is quite unlikely.      Litecoin continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle pattern. Trading is likely to be volatile until the price breaks out or breaks down. If the LTC/USD pair breaks down from the symmetrical triangle, it will become negative and slide to $175. On the upside, the bulls could face stiff resistance in the $280 - $308 zone. We don’t find any trading setups as long as the cryptocurrency trades inside the triangle. Though the bulls bought the lows on Jan. 8, the pullback did not find buyers at higher levels. Today, NEM has extended its decline towards the trendline support. We believe that the support zone between the 20-day EMA and the trendline is likely to increase buying. A bounce from these levels can’t be ruled out. Yet, we don’t expect to see a rally because chances are the XEM/USD pair will face resistance on every rise. We anticipate a range bound trading in NEM for the next few days. As forecast earlier, Cardano has declined to the 20-day EMA. With the fall, it has given up more than 61.8 percent of the gains from the latest leg of the rally from 0.00002539 to 0.00009180. We believe that the zone between the trendline and the 20-day EMA is likely to act as strong support. Hence, a pullback from the support levels can’t be ruled out. Nevertheless, positions should be initiated only on bottom confirmation because if the ADA/BTC pair breaks down of the trendline, it can fall to 0.00002539 levels.

80,2018-01-11 18:55:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Announces Partnership With MoneyGram To Speed Fiat Settlements,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Ripple announces that it will partner with to enhance the fiat payment platform’s settlement rates. Brief Blockchain-based payments gateway Ripple announced a new partnership with payment service MoneyGram today, Jan. 11. In a blog post today, Ripple confirmed that MoneyGram would integrate Ripple’s XRP altcoin into its payment system. The integration, according to Ripple, “allows MoneyGram to solve the age-old liquidity issue most financial institutions face.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented in company’s blog post announcing the partnership: “The payments problem doesn’t just affect banks; it also affects companies like MoneyGram, which help people get money to the ones they care about. By using a digital asset like XRP that settles in three seconds or less, our clients can move money as quickly as information.” Garlinghouse has increasingly championed XRP’s perceived advantages as a currency over Bitcoin as interest and trade increased. Given Ripple’s market value in early January, the company’s chairman, Chris Larsen, was then reported to have accrued personal wealth to rival Warren Buffett and Bill Gates due to his 37 percent stake. Ripple has unveiled several partnership deals in recent weeks, and in the first week of 2018, the value of XRP skyrocketed to highs barely imaginable just months ago. While the rate of appreciation drew no shortage of warnings and criticism, the refusal of Coinbase to add the altcoin reportedly precipitated a 30 percent downturn last week, something the latest news appears to be changing. XRP is up almost eight percent in the 24 hours to press time according to data from CoinMarketCap, which since Jan. 8 does not include some major South Korean markets.

81,2018-01-11 21:05:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Hate: Is Ripple a Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing?,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Ripple exhibits a few traits that many in the cryptocurrency community do not approve of. Analysis Cryptocurrency purists have always judged new coins by a few important factors. On top of that list has always been decentralization. However, one of the bigger coins in the cryptocurrency market has been hiding in plain sight with its centralized nature. But, its recent boom that saw it finish last year as one of top performing crypto assets has seen it garner a lot of hate. Ripple, a token created by the company of the same name that aims to facilitate transfers between major financial corporations. In this goal, it has seen much success over 2017 with a few major banks partnering with it. Despite working with central banks, it is the centralized nature that has many up in arms. When the system was created in 2013, the development team removed many of the key features you find in most other cryptocurrencies. This was done in so that the token could be geared towards these major financial institutions, which is fine and probably necessary, but it becomes problematic when Ripple is counted in the same breath as Bitcoin and other very decentralized digital currencies. Ripple issues its token in a centralized fashion, unlike other coins which are mined and incentivized by people dedicating computing power to accumulate them. Many in the community, including creators of other coins, have slammed Ripple’s definition as a cryptocurrency. “For the most part, I’m not frustrated or angry with Ripple, I’m frustrated with the community’s general lack of knowledge these days (i.e., Ripple is a symptom, but not the problem itself),” Reddit user thieflar, a moderator of the Bitcoin subreddit, tells Inverse. “The fact that Ripple is labeled as a “cryptocurrency” and included on sites like CoinMarketCap has been, for the most part, seen as misleading and inaccurate for many years now,” thieflar adds. Litecoin creator, Charlie Lee, has said that he does not believe that Ripple should even be considered a cryptocurrency. R3 sues Ripple for $1B. Option to buy 5B XRPs?! Circulation supply is only 38B. ???? XRP is NOT a crypto-currency.https://t.co/gVx2IIgk5a pic.twitter.com/hBQw1RvgQb Additionally, Cointelegraph writer, Joseph Young has shared similar sentiments. Ripple is locking up $14 billion of its native ""currency"" to control its price?Locking funds itself is bad. The intent is even worse. pic.twitter.com/X9xaqJHDfV Despite the mixed opinions of Ripple, it still made big gains in 2017, going up 36,000 percent. This caused it’s market cap to push the coin up to second on Coinmarketcap for a period. However, even this accolade has been slammed. “It seems like the multiple-year-long cryptocurrency bull-market eventually reached a point where newcomers have been buying indiscriminately, not understanding anything about what they are buying other than ‘it’s a crypto coin so you can make money with it,’ and Ripple managed to get caught up in the madness,” thieflar continues. Interestingly, Ripple itself agrees that it should not be bought indiscriminately to try and make money off the gains. “Private exchanges and liquidity providers may choose to hold additional XRP for trading. Ripple (the company) does not promote XRP as a speculative investment,” it is stated in their gateway guide.

82,2018-01-12 23:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 12","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Are there signs of waning momentum? Price Analysis The South Korean government has confirmed that it has no plans to ban cryptocurrency trading in the short-term. This is a major relief to the markets, which were reeling under selling pressure. Warren Buffet’s warning that the cryptocurrencies will have a “bad ending” also did not have any noticeable effect on the prices. During the recent decline, instead of being perturbed, many traders saw this as a buying opportunity and rushed to open new accounts. The cryptocurrency exchange Binance saw a whopping addition of 240,000 users in just an hour on Jan. 10. However, unlike the previous occasions, the pullback from the lows has been muted. Is this a sign of waning momentum? Let’s find out. Bitcoin broke below the 50-day SMA on Jan. 11 and since then, it has been struggling to climb above it. It has managed to hold on to the critical support level between the trendline of the symmetrical triangle and the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.  If Bitcoin fails to rally within the next two days, chances are that it will turn down and break below $12,500, sinking it to $8,000 levels. On the other hand, if the cryptocurrency clings on to the support and moves above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate a short-term bottom. Very aggressive traders can buy on a breakout above $14,500 and keep a stop loss of $12,500. The target objective of this trade is $16,500. This is a very risky trade, hence, should be attempted with only 25 percent of the usual position size. Risk-averse traders should wait for a reliable setup to form as there is no clear trend on the BTC/USD pair as long as it trades inside the triangle. It’s better to wait for a breakout or breakdown from the triangle before initiating any positions. Ethereum has been comparatively strong during the South Korean ban episode. This shows that its owners are not in a hurry to sell their holdings.     The buyers jumped in at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the latest rally from $640.43 to $1,382. The uptrend remains intact and the bulls are likely to make another attempt to break out of the recent highs at $1,382. If the price breaks out of the overhead resistance zone of $1,382 to $1,434, it will signal the start of the next leg of the up move, which can carry the ETH/USD pair towards its target objective of $1,814.67. On the downside, support exists at the 20-day EMA and at $965.18, which is the intraday low on Jan. 8. However, as we expect a strong resistance between $1,382 and $1,434, we are not recommending any fresh long positions in it. Bitcoin Cash broke out of the range on Jan. 10, however, contrary to our expectation, it could not rally to $3,249. It faced strong resistance at $2,950 and turned down from there.  It continues to be range bound but in a larger range. On the upside, $2,950 is the critical resistance and on the downside, $2,291 continues to be a strong support. If this support breaks, it has another support at the $2,072 level. Traders should wait for a breakout above $2950 to initiate long positions. The breakout is likely to carry the BCH/USD pair towards the highs. On the other hand, a breakdown below $2,072 can result in a decline to $1,733 and thereafter to $1,200.     For the past three days, Ripple has been attempting to hold the uptrend line. The bulls continue to buy the dips close to the $1.5 levels.  The cryptocurrency is currently correcting inside a descending channel. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the resistance line of the channel, a move to $2.85 is likely. Strong support exists between $1.76978 and $1.40463, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally from $0.22255 to $3.317. But we don’t find any reliable buy setups on the XRP/USD pair. Hence, we are not recommending any trade on it.      IOTA has continued its range-bound trading between $3.032 and $4.34. Yesterday, Jan. 11, the bulls again defended the lower end of the range.  We expect the range to hold.  Hence, traders can buy on weakness towards $3.1 and keep a stop loss of $2.7. The IOTA/USD pair should attempt to move towards $4.34 once it breaks out of the downtrend line. A move above $4.34 is likely to propel it towards the upper end of the range at $5.59. Our bullish view will be invalidated if price breaks down and sustains below $3.032.     Litecoin is still stuck inside the symmetrical triangle. Yesterday, Jan.11,  the bears failed to break down of the triangle.  The bulls will now try to push prices towards the resistance line of the triangle at $280. The move will gain momentum above $254. The support is way lower at $215. At the moment the risk to reward ratio is not attractive for trades. The LTC/USD pair will become bearish if price breaks down and sustains below the 50-day SMA. As forecast in our previous analysis, the decline to the trendline support prompted buying. NEM is currently in a pullback. Should we trade this?  The traders bought the dip below the trendline support yesterday, Jan. 11. We now expect the XEM/USD pair to rally to $1.56949 and $1.68590, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent fall from $2.06278 to $1.07619. The aggressive traders can buy at the current levels of $1.38 and keep a stop loss at $1.06, below yesterday’s lows. Though the initial risk to reward ratio is not attractive, we believe that buying near the strong support of the trendline is a good strategy. Buyers bought the dip below the trendline on Jan. 11. We had forecast a pullback from the trendline in our previous analysis but advised waiting for a confirmation of a bottom before buying. So, can the traders buy now?  If the pullback sustains above the 0.000057 levels, we expect the move to extend to $0.00006616 and $0.00007221, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent fall. Traders can buy the ADA/BTC pair at the current levels and keep a stop loss at 0.00004. Here too, we are recommending a trade without an attractive risk to reward ratio because we are buying close to the strong support of the trendline from where the price can surprise on the upside.

83,2018-01-17 01:35:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan 16: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, and Cardano","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   No a calm day for the crypto market, with almost all cryptocurrencies down 20% over the last 24 hours.   The past few days have seen a series of flip-flops on news. First was the news of the Korean government banning cryptocurrency trading that led to a sharp fall in prices. Then came the rebuttal that there was going to be no ban in the near future. The latest news from South Korea is that they have still not given up on the plan to shutdown cryptocurrency exchanges. The markets reacted with a selloff in all virtual currencies. The second news was that Ripple had partnered with MoneyGram for money transfers. This shows that the traders should not impulsively buy or sell on any news. It’s always better to wait for a trend to form and then buy into it. Is the current fall a buying opportunity or is there more to go? Let’s find out. For the past four days, the bulls have been attempting to hold the critical support of $12,600 to $12,900 in Bitcoin and push prices back into the symmetrical triangle.  However, the bears did not allow the pullback to cross above the 20-day EMA. Today, when the cryptocurrency broke below $12,500, it attracted huge selling, which resulted in a sharp decline to $11,000, close to the next support of $10,704.99. We believe that the bulls will attempt to pullback from the current levels, but the bounce will not sustain and the BTC/USD pair will crack the $10,704.99 level and fall to $8,000. The 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA have completed a bearish crossover, which is a negative development. Our bearish view will be invalidated if price climbs back above $15,000 levels. In our previous two analysis, we said that Ethereum will find it difficult to breakout of the overhead resistance zone of $1382 and $1434 and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency returned from a high of $1424.3 on Jan. 13.    After maintaining above the $1250 levels for three days, the bears broke down below the support, which attracted profit booking. As a result, the cryptocurrency plunged to $966.64, which is just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally. We also find a negative divergence on the RSI, which is a bearish development. If the support zone between the trendline and $940 holds, we may see an attempt to pullback, which is likely to result in a range bound trading in the next few days. Our view of a trading range in the ETH/USD pair will be invalidated if price breaks below the uptrend line. After trading inside a range of $2072 to $2950 for the past few days, Bitcoin Cash broke down below support.  The pattern target on the BCH/USD pair following the breakdown is $1,194, however, we expect the bulls to attempt to hold $1733 levels, which was the intraday low on Dec. 22. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls succeed in pushing prices back into the range, above $2072.68. We had forecast a possibility of a fall to $1.40 in Ripple on Jan.6. Today, the cryptocurrency touched a low of $1.17.  The correction has broken below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, which suggests weakness. The cryptocurrency is currently trading inside a descending channel. The downtrend will end when the bulls breakout and sustain above the channel. Though the XRP/USD pair has plunged about 65 percent from its highs, we shall buy it only after it confirms a bottom formation.       There is a tussle between the bulls and the bears at the critical support of $3.03 in IOTA. While the bears have broken below the supports, the bulls are attempting a pullback.  Along with the range, we also located a bearish descending triangle pattern on the IOTA/USD pair, which will complete if the bears manage to sustain below $3.03. Such a breakdown is likely to result in a decline towards the December 22 low of $1.10. On the other hand, if the bulls hold the support, the virtual currency is likely to continue its range bound trading.    Today, Litecoin broke down below the symmetrical triangle pattern and also the 50-day SMA, which is a negative development.  The bulls are attempting to hold the critical support of $175.19. If successful, a return to $230 is likely. On the other hand, if the bears break below $175.19, a move towards $100 is likely. Due to the uncertainty, we are not recommending any trade on the LTC/USD pair. We had suggested a long position in NEM in our previous analysis. The pullback on Jan. 13 did not reach our target levels and our stop loss was triggered today, when the bears broke below the uptrend line.  The bulls are attempting to hold the 50-day SMA, which is close to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. If successful, we may see a pullback towards the trendline, else a fall to $0.59 is possible. We don’t find any setup on the XEM/USD pair, hence, we are not recommending any trade on it. We are carrying long positions in Cardano from 0.00005733 levels. Though price reached our first target of $0.00006616, it could not reach the second target objective of $0.00007221, because it topped out at 0.00006915. So, what should we do now?  Currently, the ADA/BTC pair is holding the critical trendline support. Hence, for the traders who did not sell in the rally on Jan. 13, we recommend closing the position at the current levels. We don’t want to carry a long position when the overall sentiment is heavily bearish because a breakdown of the trendline can extend the fall to 0.00004 levels. A breakout of the downtrend line will be the first indication that the fall is over. The market data is provided by TradingView.

84,2018-01-20 03:27:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan. 19: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Cointelegraph presents the latest trading review on most popular cryptocurrencies.   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After a sharp fall, the aggressive bulls jump in and buy at lower levels. This strategy has resulted in huge gains for the cryptocurrency traders in 2017. However, unlike previous occasions, we have not seen a sharp rise this time. This shows that the traders are not confident of a huge rally from the current prices. In the next few days, we expect a range bound action in most of the top cryptocurrencies. We had expected a pullback from the $10,704.99 levels. But Bitcoin overshot on the downside and fell to $9,300 levels.  Currently, the bulls are attempting a reversal, which is likely to carry the cryptocurrency to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern at $13,202 levels. We expect another round of selling from those levels, which is likely to sink the BTC/USD pair back to the support zone of $10,704.99 to $9,300. If this support zone breaks, a fall below $8,000 is likely. On the other hand, if the bulls succeed in holding the support zone, it will lead to a start of a new uptrend. Nimble-footed traders can play the rise, but others should wait for more clarity to develop. We expected the support zone between the trendline and $940 to hold. On Jan. 17, Ethereum broke below the trendline and fell to a low of $770.     The bulls bought the dip aggressively, which has resulted in a pullback that carried the cryptocurrency towards the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent fall from $1424 to $770. For the past three days, the ETH/USD pair has been struggling to cross above $1097. If the price breaks out of the $1100 levels, we expect a move to $1174.36 and $1284.28 levels. As the stop loss is $930, which doesn’t offer a good risk to reward ratio, we are not suggesting any trade on it.   We expected the $1733 levels to hold. Still, the bears easily broke through it and Bitcoin Cash fell to a low of $1364.96 on Jan. 18.  The current increase is likely to face resistance at the $2072 levels, which was the support of the range previously. We shall get a confirmation of a bottom during the next downturn. If $1364.96 breaks, a fall to $1194 is likely. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair sustains above $2072 for a day. We had forecast a fall to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the latest rally, however, Ripple fell close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels, which coincided with the lower end of the descending channel.  The cryptocurrency has broken out of the descending channel, which suggests that the downtrend is over. However, the present increase is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, above which a move to $2.20 is likely. At that price, the XRP/USD pair will face resistance from the trendline that had previously acted as a strong support. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to break above the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to resume the downtrend. Support lies at $0.87. We expect a few days of range bound trading.      IOTA broke down of the bearish descending triangle pattern on January 16, which gives it a pattern target of $1.10.  However, the cryptocurrency took support at $1.93 levels on Jan. 17. Currently, the IOTA/USD pair is retesting the breakout levels of $3.032. If the bulls breakout of the overhead resistance and the downtrend line, our bearish view will be invalidated. However, if the bears defend the $3.032 levels, we are likely to see another bout of selling, which will retest the lows.   We don’t find any clear pattern; hence, we are not recommending any trade.    We had forecast a likely fall to $100 if Litecoin broke below $175.19. It rose from a low of $140.00 on Jan. 17.  For two days in a row, Jan. 16 and Jan. 17, the bears broke down below $175.19 but were unsuccessful in holding prices down. If the bulls breakout of $205, a move to $225 is likely, where both the moving averages converge. This level is likely to act as a resistance.   We don’t find any reasonable trades on LTC/USD pair. NEM fell close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels on Jan. 16 and Jan. 17. Thereafter, the bulls have commenced a pullback, which is likely to face a strong resistance at the downward trendline.  If the price moves above the downtrend line, an increase to $1.45 can’t be ruled out. The next fall towards the recent lows of $0.55134 will confirm whether the bottom is in place or is there further to go. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines on the XEM/USD pair. Cardano broke below the trendline support on Jan. 16 and Jan. 17, however, the bulls defended the support and pushed prices higher quickly.  The ADA/BTC pair broke out of the downtrend line yesterday, Jan. 18, however, it could not pick up momentum. It is struggling to rally above 0.00006. Once bulls breakout of 0.00006, a move to 0.00007 and thereafter to the 0.00008 levels is likely. The cryptocurrency pair will become negative below 0.00004730.

85,2018-01-24 01:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 23","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Take a look at what orders to place and what buys to avoid.   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. When the markets are bullish, a lot of traders only focus on high target levels. This leads to a left out feeling among the ones who have missed out on the rally, and they rush to buy at elevated levels. This results in a huge loss of capital to the uninformed traders. The opposite works when the market falls. One starts to hear bearish voices with the analysts forecasting apocalypse and novice traders get scared and dump their holdings. They buy when they should be selling and sell when they should be buying. Hence, it is always better to take these forecasts with a pinch of salt. We, therefore, avoid giving unrealistic target levels to our readers and try to keep them on the right side of the trade. In our previous analysis, we had predicted that Bitcoin would turn down from the $13,202 levels and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency topped out at $12,988.89 on Jan. 20. It is currently retesting the critical support zone of $10,704.99 to $9,300.    For the past two days, the bulls are defending the $10,000 levels. If this level holds, we may see another attempt to pull back. The trend will turn positive in the short-term only when the BTC/USD pair breaks out of the down trendline 1. This trade should be taken with only 50 percent allocation because on the way up, Bitcoin will face resistance at the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern and at the down trendline 2. On the downside, a break of $10,000 is likely to hurt sentiment, resulting in a decline to $8,000 levels. We had forecast a rally to $1174.36, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent fall from $1424 to $770 and Ethereum topped out at $1,160 on Jan 20.     The price has returned to the trendline support, which has offered strong support since Dec. 10. The bulls have been attempting to hold the trendline support for the past two days. We believe the support zone between $900 and $845 is likely to be defended strongly by the bulls. The ETH/USD pair will indicate a change in trend only after it breaks out of the down trendline. If the above-mentioned support zone breaks, the decline can extend to $770 levels. We don’t find any buy setups; hence, we are not suggesting any trade on it.   In our previous analysis, we had anticipated Bitcoin Cash to return from the $2,072 levels, and it topped out at $2,112.11 on Jan. 20.  The moving average has completed a bearish crossover, and the price is quoting below the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA; which is advantageous to bears. If the retest of the recent lows at $1364.96 fails, a fall to $1194 is likely. If the bulls defend the $1364.96 levels, the BCH/USD pair is likely to become range-bound for a few days. As the trend is still down, we are not suggesting any trade on it. Ripple returned from the 20-day EMA on Jan. 18. It currently has support at the $0.87 levels.  We believe that the XRP/USD pair will become range bound for the next few days between the support of $0.87 and the resistance of $1.74. We shall wait for a breakout above the overhead resistance to initiate any long positions. On the downside, though we expect the $0.87 to hold, it might be reasonable to wait for a bounce before buying. As the trading inside the range is likely to be volatile, we shall only try to buy closer to the supports.       We had mentioned that $3.032 is the critical level for IOTA and a failure to break out above it will attract another bout of selling and that is what happened.  The cryptocurrency is currently attempting to hold the Jan. 16 low of $1.923. If the bears succeed in breaking down this support, a fall to the lows of Dec. 22 of $1.10 is likely. If the bulls hold the $1.923 levels, the IOTA/USD pair is likely to remain range bound for the next few days. It will become positive only if the price breaks out of the down trendline of the descending triangle. Litecoin broke above $205, but could not reach $225, as we had expected. It turned down from $214.48 levels on Jan. 20.  The bears are trying to break down of the critical support level of $175.19. If successful, a fall to $140 is likely. In the short-term, the first sign of bullishness will be when the LTC/USD pair breaks out of $215. Currently, we don’t find any trade set up on it. On Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, the bulls could not sustain above the downtrend line. As a result, NEM has resumed its decline.  Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold the $0.86 level. If this breaks, a fall to the Jan. 16 lows of $0.551 is likely. On the upside, the down trendline is likely to offer strong resistance. The first signs of bullishness will be when price breaks out of the $1.21 levels. We don’t find any trade setups on the XEM/USD pair. Cardano could not break out of the 0.00006 levels. It is now likely to gradually fall to the support levels of 0.000047, and after that to 0.00004070.  For the next few days, we expect the ADA/BTC pair to remain range bound between 0.00004070 on the downside and 0.00006915 on the upside. We shall wait for the pair to bounce from one of the support levels before initiating any trade. At the present levels, we don’t find any bullish setups on it.

86,2018-01-25 22:01:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 25","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   As the market seems to be recovering, see what orders might be a good idea (or not).   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The massive upwards movement in cryptocurrencies over 2017 has not gone unnoticed. The participants at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos are being questioned about cryptocurrencies and Cointelegraph has been one of the main voices representing the fraternity. The traditional investors are still not willing to accept the rising clout of the cryptocurrencies and are pushing for tighter regulation. Only recently, Nordea Bank banned its employees from owning Bitcoin by Feb. 28. However, this move is facing strong opposition from the large unions. Even the fears of a cryptocurrency ban by South Korea gathered a massive petition opposing the move. Finally, the Korean government only banned the traders from using anonymous bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading. The classical investors and regulators fail to understand that these kinds of bans are unlikely to dent the popularity of the cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is currently in no man’s land. It is facing resistance at the down trendline one. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this resistance, we can expect a rally towards the down trendline two. Aggressive traders can trade this pullback. Others should wait for a confirmation of a bottom formation because, if the bulls fail to sustain above the down trendline one, the likelihood of $10,000 levels breakdown increases. Unlike the previous falls, this time, the BTC/USD pair is struggling to hold on to higher levels. With the price quoting below both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA, the trend remains down to range bound. The downtrend will reassert itself if the price breaks down to $10,000 levels. So, the swing traders should wait and watch for the next few days for the trend to change from down to up before initiating any long positions. Ethereum is in a pullback in an uptrend because it is still quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Additionally, it has successfully held on to the uptrend line, which is another positive sign.    But the 20-day EMA has flattened out, which points to a range bound trading action for the next few days. The support of the range is likely to be at $900 levels, whereas, the resistance will be at $1,160 levels. The ETH/USD pair will become negative only after it breaks down of the trendline and the 50-day SMA, which is at $845. Long positions for the medium-term can be initiated on dips to $1,000 levels, with a stop loss at $840. We believe that if the 50-day SMA holds, the cryptocurrency will attempt to resume its uptrend and rally to the highs. This is a risky trade, hence, please keep the position size small. The traders, both the bulls and the bears, are not taking any keen interest in Bitcoin Cash. As a result, it has been trading in a small range since Jan. 23. Support on the downside exists at the Jan. 17 low, $1,364.9657. On the upside, as the moving averages have completed bearish crossover, the 20-day EMA is likely to act as a resistance. Additionally, the $2,072 levels and the downtrend line will also act as a strong overhead resistance. We don’t find any tradable setup on the BCH/USD pair. Ripple has formed a doji candlestick pattern on both Jan. 23 and Jan. 24. Even the price action currently points to a very small range day. As forecast in our previous analysis, the XRP/USD pair is likely to remain range bound between $0.87 and $1.74. A trading opportunity will pop up only if the supports of the range hold or if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the overhead resistance. We should wait until then.       IOTA’s range has been shrinking for the past two days. It has formed successive inside day candlestick patterns on Jan. 23 and Jan. 24. Today, it is trying to resume the downtrend. On the downside, support exists at $1.9232 levels. If this breaks, the IOTA/USD pair can extend its losses to the Dec. 22 low of $1.1. The first signs of a recovery will be seen once the price breaks out of $3.032 and the down trendline of the descending triangle. If the support and the overhead resistance levels hold, we may see a few days of range bound action. Litecoin has held on to the critical support level of $175.199. However, the bounce doesn’t have any strength, which shows a lack of interest in buyers. If the bears succeed in breaking down the supports, a fall to $140.001 is likely. On the other hand, the first signs of a recovery will be on a breakout above $215 levels. Aggressive traders can buy the LTC/USD pair at $187, which is just above the high of past couple of days. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $163 and the target objective is $215. However, this is a very risky trade, hence, please place it only with less than 50 percent of the usual allocation. NEM has held on to the 0.86 levels for the past few days, but the bulls are unable to push prices above the down trendline. This is likely to lead to another attempt to break down of $0.86 within a couple of days. If the bears succeed, a fall to the Jan. 16 lows of $0.55134 is likely. The 20-day EMA has turned down and is likely to complete a bearish crossover if the support breaks. We don’t find any bullish setups on the XEM/USD pair with price trading below the trendline and both the moving averages. A change in trend will be signaled once it rallies above $1.21. Cardano is again attempting to break out of the 0.00006 levels. If successful, it is likely to rally to the overhead resistance at 0.00006915. A very short-term trader can buy at 0.00006 with a stop loss of 0.00005. This is a risky trade, hence, please attempt it with less than 50 percent of the usual position size. Swing traders should wait for a breakout of the 0.00006915 levels to initiate any long positions. We believe that unless the sentiment turns bullish for the cryptocurrencies, the ADA/BTC pair will find it difficult to breakout of the overhead resistance and may drift down to 0.000047 to 0.000049 levels again, which can be a good level to initiate long positions.

87,2018-01-27 22:08:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 27","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   The latest prices overview is served.   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After the discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world leaders are getting ready to deliberate on cryptocurrencies in the forthcoming G20 summit in March. Many leaders seek to regulate cryptocurrencies, but if we study the consequences of the Chinese regulations, we find that they have been ineffective. Traders based in China have started trading at cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has only increased the risk for their traders because now they are forced to buy Bitcoin at a premium of about $1,200 compared to other exchanges. The leaders and central banks, instead of blindly opposing cryptocurrencies should chalk out a strategy to embrace them after discussing with the crypto stalwarts. The Bitcoin bulls have been defending the $10,000 mark for the past few days. But they have not been able to push prices higher, which is a point of concern.  The cryptocurrency has broken out of the down trendline one, which shows that the momentum on the downside has decreased. We can expect a few more days of range bound action between $10,000 and $12,000. It is difficult to predict whether the upside or the downside move comes next. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the 20-day EMA, which is currently at $12,218, the BTC/USD pair should rally to the down trendline two. The traders can wait for the breakout above $12,200 to sustain for about 4-hours and then buy with a stop-loss at $9,900. The target objective is a move to $14,500. On the downside, if the bears break below $9,900, the selling is likely to intensify. The next stop on the downside is $8,000. As we are uncertain about the next move, we have elucidated both possibilities. We don’t find any setups as long as the price remains within the range. In our previous analysis, we had recommended long positions in Ethereum on dips to $1,000. Our long positions were triggered yesterday, Jan. 27.      After touching an intraday high of $1,102.4 on Jan. 25, the cryptocurrency fell to the down trendline yesterday, Jan. 26. Now, if it manages to break out of $1,110, we can expect it to rally to $1,174.36 levels. Once the ETH/USD pair breaks out of $1,110, traders should raise the stop loss from the current levels of $840 to $950. That will decrease our risk. Partial profits can be booked at $1,170 levels, and the stops on the remaining positions should be trailed higher. Bitcoin Cash has a history of entering into small range trading days, before a significant breakout or a breakdown. We had seen a similar pattern in August and October last year, 2017.  Currently, the price has been stuck in a tight range of $1,479 on the downside and $1,700 on the upside. Any breakout of this range is likely to face a slew of resistance at the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line and $2,072.6853. On the downside, support is at the January 17th low of $1364.9657 and $1141. We don’t find any tradable setup on the BCH/USD pair. Ripple continues to trade inside the range of $0.87 and $1.74 with a downward bias. If the cryptocurrency breaks down of $1.09 levels, a fall to the lower end of the range is likely.  The XRP/USD pair is struggling to find any buyers. Therefore, we should wait for the cryptocurrency to bounce off the $0.87 lows before initiating any long positions. The probable bearish crossover of the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA is another negative sign. We anticipate the range-bound trading action to continue for the next few days.       Stellar is comparatively stronger cryptocurrency because it is quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA and both are trending higher, whereas, most other top currencies are witnessing a bearish crossover of the moving averages.  If the overall sentiment remains subdued, we believe that the XLM/USD pair will face resistance at the $0.671 mark. Currently, we don’t have a suitable stop loss, so, we’d better wait for a correction to the trendline before initiating any long positions. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of the $0.671 mark, a move towards the highs is likely, with a small resistance at $0.732 levels. It might be a good idea to wait for a low-risk trading opportunity to initiate fresh positions. Litecoin broke below the $175 support level yesterday, Jan. 26, but recovered and closed above it by the end of the day.  What might be worth considering is the fact that the bulls are not able to push prices higher. If we don’t get an upside massive range move within a couple of days, chances are that the bears will again attempt to sink the cryptocurrency. On the downside, support exists at $140.001, which is the intraday low of Jan. 17. If this level also breaks, the LTC/USD pair can sink to the next support level of $85. If the bulls manage to push prices higher, they will face resistance at $200 from the 20-day EMA and at the down trendline of the descending triangle. We should change our bearish view only after price breaks out of $225. NEM broke below the $0.86 levels yesterday, Jan. 26, and made an intraday low of $0.775. However, the bears were not able to capitalize on the breakdown.  Today, we find some buying at the lower levels. The bulls are attempting to break out of the down trendline, which continues to be major resistance. Even if the price breaks out of this, we expect the XEM/USD pair to face resistance at the $1 levels from both the moving averages. The cryptocurrency will become bullish once it breaks out of $1.21 levels. We shall wait for it to turn positive before recommending any long positions. Cardano again failed to break out of 0.00006. That’s why the buy suggested in the previous analysis did not trigger.  The ADA/BTC pair is now likely to fall to the 0.00005 levels, which should act as a support. However, if this level breaks, a fall to 0.00004730 and after that to 0.00004070 can’t be ruled out. We shall wait for the cryptocurrency to turn bullish before recommending any fresh positions.

88,2018-01-29 21:07:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 29","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   See if you should go long or short.   Historically, January has always been a weak month for Bitcoin and 2018 is no exception. Some believe that this is due to Chinese investors converting their Bitcoins to fiat currency in order to buy gifts and presents to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls in February. After all, the Chinese market is one of the major players in the crypto world. However, the same behaviour does not hold true for stocks, because the Hong Kong and Chinese markets have been among the top performers. The equity markets are outperforming the crypto markets, at least in the first month of the year. With only a couple of days more left in January, it remains to be seen if the fortunes of the large cryptocurrencies take a turn in February. Bitcoin turned down from the 20-day EMA on January 28. We had suggested a long position on a close above $12,200, which did not trigger. In the very short-term, we find another descending triangle pattern as shown in the chart. The pattern will complete on a breakdown and close below $9,920 levels. Below this level, we are likely to see further selling pressure by the bears and some long liquidation from the aggressive bulls who have accumulated close to the $10,000 to $12,000 levels expecting a spike up. Panic selling can drag the BTC/USD pair to $8,000 and potentially even further down to $6,000 levels. These lower levels look scary, but please note, we are not trying to instill fear among traders. We are just giving the possible lower levels developing according to the chart patterns. It is important to keep in mind that if Bitcoin breaks out of the $12,000 levels, it will invalidate a bearish pattern; and that is a bullish sign. Therefore, our recommendation is a likely long position at $12250, with a stop loss of $9,900 and a target objective of $14,000. Within the range of $9,900 and $12,200, we don’t find any buy setups. We are holding long positions in Ethereum from $1,000 levels. We had recommended booking partial profits at $1,170 levels, in our previous analysis.      Yesterday, January 28, the Ethereum rallied to an intraday high of $1,265, which is close to 78.6 percent retracement levels of the recent fall from $1,424.3 to $770. Traders can keep a stop loss of $1,000 on the remaining position because if the ETH/USD pair stays above $1,160, it is likely to again attempt a breakout above $1,284.28 levels. If the $1,000 level breaks, Ethereum is likely to slide to the trendline. Yesterday, January 28, Bitcoin Cash broke out of the small overhead resistance at $1,700, but could not continue to build on the gain. The cryptocurrency has again turned back down and has fallen below $1,700 levels. On any upwards movement, the bulls are likely to face strong resistance at the 20-day EMA, which is roughly at the same level as the down trendline. Above this, the next level of resistance is at $2,072.6853. The BCH/USD pair will become positive in the short-term only after it sustains above $2,072.6853. Until then, all pullbacks are likely to be sold. On the downside, a fall below $1,364.9657 will plunge the price to $1,141 levels. We don’t find any buy setups, so we do not recommend any long positions. Currently, Ripple is trading in the center of the range. It is likely to fall to the lower end of the range if it breaks down of the immediate support at $1.09. We expect the XRP/USD pair to remain in the large range of $0.87 to $1.74 for the next few days. We are likely to wait for a dip in support levels or the range breakout to initiate fresh long positions.       With general sentiment across the crypto community remaining weak, Stellar has turned down from the overhead resistance. It is now likely to fall to the trendline support, as we have forecasted in our previous analysis. The 20-day EMA and the trendline support are close - that is why we expect the $0.55 levels to hold. We can initiate long positions once the XLM/USD pair breaks out of the $0.671 mark. We foresee a retest of the highs, with small resistance at $0.732 levels. But if the trendline support breaks, a fall to the 50-day SMA is likely. We shall buy only on a strong rebound off the trendline. Yesterday, January 28, the attempt by the bulls to carry Litecoin higher faced resistance at the 20-day EMA. Now, we anticipate another round of selling by the bears to breakdown below the critical support of $175. If the bears succeed in sustaining below $175, a fall to $140.001 and thereafter to $85 is likely. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair breaks out of the down trendline of the descending triangle. We had forecast that NEM will face resistance at the $1 levels from both the moving averages and that is what happened. If the bears fail to sink the cryptocurrency back below the down trendline, we anticipate a range bound trading between $0.8 on the lower end and $1.2 on the upper end. The XEM/USD pair will become positive in the short-term on a breakout and close above $1.21. Currently, we are unable to find any reliable buy setups on it, so we do not have any recommendations for trading. Cardano is currently trading inside a tight range of 0.00005 and 0.00006. If support of this range breaks, a fall to 0.00004730 and after that to the lower end of the larger range at 0.00004070 is likely. However, if the bulls defend the 0.00005 levels again, the range bound trading action will continue for a few more days. Within this tight range, we are unable to find any bullish pattern, so we do not advise any trading on the ADA/BTC pair.

89,2018-02-01 01:38:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Jan. 31","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   EOS and NEO have joined the club.   With the news from South Korea confirming government’s positive stance on cryptocurrencies trading, the market still remains volatile. If it doesn’t recover within the next few days, negative news might prompt the bulls selling, that will lead to long liquidation. However, if the bulls succeed in defending the critical support levels, we might see a sharp pullback and the money sitting on the sidelines will rush into the markets, providing a further boost to the upside. We believe that we should see a strong move up or down within the next 3-5 days. Let’s see how we can capitalize on this.    Bitcoin price went down yesterday, January 30, resulting in a sharp decline. Currently, it is finding support just below the critical level of $9,920.02.   Yesterday, January 30, was the first close below the December 22 lows of $10,704.99. This shows that the sellers are gaining an upper hand at lower levels. If the bears build on their advantage and break below the $9,300 levels, we should see a slump to $8,000. If the BTC/USD pair makes a new low, we shall not buy. However, if the bulls regroup themselves and buy aggressively, pushing prices above the downtrend line, it will signal a likely reversal. That’s why we suggest buying on a close above $12,200 with an initial stop loss of $9,600. We expect the bounce to face strong resistance at $14,000 levels. Though this trade doesn’t offer a good risk to reward ratio, we suggest taking it because the goal to buy as close to the bottom as possible. We should close the position quickly if it doesn’t gain momentum above $12,200. As the chances of a whipsaw are high, please keep the allocation size at 50 percent of normal. Ethereum continues to be strong as it is still trading above the uptrend line and above both moving averages. We are holding 50 percent of our original purchase done at $1,000 levels with the stops at breakeven. We remain bullish on the ETH/USD pair because it continues to form a higher low on the charts. This shows that the bulls are eager to buy on dips, so they don’t let prices fall. But the up move is facing profit booking at higher levels. As a result, the 20-day EMA has turned flat, which points to a consolidation in the short-term. The 50-day SMA continues to rise indicating the uptrend continuation. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency plunges below the uptrend line and the 50-day SMA.   Bitcoin Cash is down around 64 percent from its peak of $4,139.0893, that was reached on December 20, 2017. $1,364.9657 is an important support level on the downside. If the BCH/USD pair breaks below this, we anticipate a fall to $1,150 levels, which is the next major support. If this level holds, the bulls will attempt to break out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. In case they succeed, we can expect the cryptocurrency to remain range-bound between $1,364.9657 and $2,072.6853. Ripple continues to be under pressure. It is unable to settle at any support level. Currently, it is taking support at the psychological level of $1. If this level breaks down, we can expect a slide to the lower end of the range at $0.87. If we find strong buying emerge at this support level, we may consider initiating long positions. Until then, we don’t find any buy setups on the XRP/USD pair, so we don’t recommend any trade on it.        Stellar has broken down of the trendline immediate support and the price is quoting below the 20-day EMA. Its next support is at the 50-day SMA and below it at the $0.41 levels. On the upside, the XLM/USD pair is likely to face resistance at the trendline and the recent swing high at $0.634 levels. Initiating long positions only above $0.65 levels might be a good move in this case. Litecoin broke below the critical support of $175, which completes the bearish descending triangle pattern. The bears are likely to push the price down to $140.001 and after that to $85 levels. On the other hand, the bulls will try to quickly reclaim the $175 levels. The LTC/USD pair will turn positive only after it crosses the downtrend line. It might be a good idea to wait for the trend to change before suggesting any trade. NEM has turned down after failing to break out of the moving averages. It is currently trying to hold the support at the downtrend line 1. If this support breaks, we might see a fall to the $0.60. The XEM/USD pair will show signs of bottoming out once it breaks out of the downtrend line 2 and sustains above $1.1. It seems reasonable to wait for a reliable buy setup to form before initiating any long positions on it. NEO has been in a strong uptrend since December 2017. During the recent correction, it has not given up much ground, which makes it a relative outperformer. It is quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, which is a bullish sign. It has formed a symmetrical triangle, which is a continuation pattern. A breakout of this pattern might resume the uptrend and carry the NEO/USD pair to the highs and then towards its target objective of $275. This way long positions can be initiated at $170 and the stop loss can be kept at $130. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency breaks down of the triangle, which can push it down towards the support zone of $85 to $100. EOS is in an uptrend from November 2017. The price has bounced off the trendline on four occasions. Currently, the price has again declined to the trendline. The 50-day SMA is also placed at the same level, and we expect the bulls to defend $10.5 levels. However, any pullback from the trendline will face resistance at the $14 levels. We expect a few more days of consolidation before a breakout. Long positions might be initiated if the EOS/USD pair holds the trendline for the next couple of days. In case the cryptocurrency breaks below the trendline, our bullish view will be invalidated.

90,2018-02-02 20:44:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, February 2, 2018","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   An analytical overview on cryptocurrencies prices, their movements and orders.   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. There are various reasons behind the panic currently gripping the crypto world – increased regulations, hacking, and crackdown by various governments. Additionally, the last leg of the rally looked frothy as traders gobbled up cryptocurrencies at crazy levels out of fear of missing out on the rally. But when the mainstream media highlights negative news, investor sentiment is affected and some traders panic and dump their positions out of fear of losing their capital. Some analysts believe that the bubble in cryptocurrencies has burst, while the others believe that the current fall is a great long-term buying opportunity. We consider the recent fall as a great buying opportunity. However, all cryptocurrencies will not rise equally from their current levels, as markets will start distinguishing between different cryptocurrencies. Therefore, we should look to buy stronger currencies that have fallen less and are bouncing off sharply from their key support levels. Let’s explore which cryptocurrencies are showing signs of a pullback. Bitcoin is in a firm bear grip. It has declined about 55 percent from its high. With the recent fall, the cryptocurrency has retraced close to 78.6 percent of the latest leg of the rally. We find first signs of buying at $8000 levels.  In 2017, the RSI fell to the oversold levels (about 30) on three occasions and all of them proved to be a good buying opportunity. Presently, the RSI is close to the oversold levels. Therefore, there is a greater likelihood of a bottom formation around the current levels. Aggressive traders can buy between $8,600 to $8,600 and keep a stop loss of $7,800. The pullback can lift the BTC/USD pair to the overhead resistance of about $10,700. We anticipate another round of selling in the resistance zone of $10,700 to $11,300 (at the 20-day EMA). Therefore, traders should book partial profits at $10,500 levels and trail the rest. This is a risky trade and should be attempted with less than 50 percent of the usual position size. The next leg down will confirm a bottom in the cryptocurrency, if it doesn’t break the recent lows of $8,000. If the lows break, the downtrend can extend to $6,000 levels. Therefore, we recommend that long-term traders should wait for a couple of days before buying.   Our stop loss on the long positions in Ethereum was hit at $1,000. It could not escape the panic that has gripped the cryptocurrency market.  Today, the ETH/USD pair broke below the uptrend line, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. It finally took support at $768, just below the panic low of $770 hit on January 17 2018. The pullback from the lows is likely to face resistance at $1,025 levels. At the current levels, the risk to reward ratio is not attractive. Therefore, we are not recommending making any trades on this currency. However, if the next fall towards the $820 to $770 level holds, we suggest long positions with a SL at $700.   Bitcoin Cash has completely retraced the last leg of the rally. It has slumped about 73 percent from its peak.    In our previous analysis, we forecasted that if the $1,364.9657 level breaks, a fall to $1,150 is likely and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $1,000 where buying emerged. The pullback can carry the BCH/USD pair to the downtrend line, where we anticipate another round of selling. Bitcoin Cash has been a laggard; hence, we want to see a further confirmation of a bottom formation before recommending any trade. We are most likely to recommend a long position if the support zone of $1,150 to $1,000 holds during the next fall. Ripple has taken the current fall on the chin. At the day’s intraday low of $0.61, it had declined 81.5 percent from lifetime highs of $3.317.  The momentum was so strong that the critical support level of $0.87, which had acted as a strong support on January 16 and January 17 also failed. The XRP/USD pair fell close to the next support level of $0.61, which is the final support, below which, a fall to $0.24 is likely. The current pullback should reach the downtrend line which should offer a strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive, so we don’t suggest any trade on it.          Stellar has broken below the 50-day EMA. At the days intraday it also broke below $0.41 and fell towards the final support of $0.296.  Strong buying at the lower levels helped the cryptocurrency pull back above the critical support of $0.41. If the level holds, we may see a range bound action on the XLM/USD pair for the next few days. Steller will likely become a buy once it breaks out of the upper end of the range at $0.64. We are not recommending a buy today because a pullback of a single day cannot confirm a bottom. After breaking the critical support of $175, the bulls failed to hold the $140.001 levels and  Litecoin fell to a low of $107.102.  Strong buying at the lows is likely to carry the LTC/USD pair towards the overhead resistance of $175. However, the cryptocurrency has been weak and its logical support is way lower at $84.708. Therefore, we don’t recommend any long positions on it.   NEM has declined about 74 percent from the highs. It has found some buying support at $0.45747, just below the critical level of $0.49.  The pullback should reach the downtrend line, which should offer strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive and the XEM/USD pair has been an underperformer. Therefore, we want to wait for a further confirmation of a bottom before cherry picking. During the next retest of the low, if the $0.45 level breaks, a slide down to the next support of $0.3672 is likely. NEO broke below the symmetrical triangle on February 1 2018. Today (February 2), it fell close to the critical support level of $93.53 which resulted in strong buying by the bulls.  The pullback in the NEO/USD pair has reached close to the breakdown point of $132, which should offer a strong resistance level. NEO is one of the stronger cryptocurrencies in the top 10 list because it is still quoting above the 50-day SMA. We consider that it might be better to buy NEO during the next fall to $105 levels. We were expecting the trendline to provide some support, but the bears easily broke down below it. EOS found buying support at the $8.4 levels, close to the critical support zone of $7.5 to $6.5.  The EOS/USD pair is comparatively strong because it is also quoting above its 50-day SMA. Aggressive traders can buy on any dips towards $9 and keep a SL of $7.4. The profit objective on the upside is a rally to $14 levels. We recommend that the long-term traders, however, should wait for a buy set up to form before initiating any long positions. Note: - Bottoms are not formed in a single day. After such a steep decline, we are likely to see a pullback and a few days of volatile price action. Therefore, we have suggested only a few trades and that too only for the aggressive trader. The long-term traders should wait for a successful retest of the lows before buying.

91,2018-02-05 20:07:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb 05","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Bitcoin has fallen below $7000, altcoins are moving down as well. See what orders to place in this volatile market, if any.   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The exponential rise in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies attracted a number of new traders who embarked on a buying spree - mainly purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards. Following the huge decline in 2018, the top 5 credit card companies have either banned or have announced a ban on cryptocurrency purchases using credit cards. As a result, late entrants to the rally, who had purchased cryptocurrency using borrowed money and are nursing losses of more than 50 percent will now be forced to square up their positions. This is likely to result in another round of panic selling, which will shake out the weak hands. These lower levels will attract a new set of investors who believe in the technology and have been waiting to invest at the right opportunity. Let us identify these lower levels that can attract buyers. On February 02, Bitcoin saw some buying at the $8,000 levels. However, the pullback failed to reach our target objective of $10,700 for the short-term traders. We anticipated a pullback to the 20-day EMA, but in a selling frenzy, the pullbacks only lasted around 1-3 days. After a day of recovery, the cryptocurrency has turned down once again. Today, the price has broken below the low formed on February 2. If the bears succeed in sustaining below the $8,000 levels, the BTC/USD pair is likely to slide down to $6,239, which is the pattern target from the break of the descending triangle. Below this, the fall can extend to the $5,450 levels, which will effectively retrace 100 percent of the latest leg of the rally. We believe that the panic selling to the above-mentioned levels offers a good buying opportunity to the long-term investors. However, investors should scale into the positions instead of buying all at once. We recommend buying about 30 to 40 percent of the desired allocation in the range of $5,500 to $5,800.    In our previous analysis, we expected some resistance at the $1,025 levels. On February 3, Ethereum turned down from a high of $999. We had also suggested long positions on a decline to the $770 to $820 levels with a stop loss of $700. We still believe that the $770 to $785 range is a strong support zone for the ETH/USD pair, however, if this support zone breaks, a slide to $640 is likely. The 78.6 percent retracement of the latest leg of the rally is at $611.34 levels. Hence, we foresee strong buying in the zone of $611.34 to $640. However, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA are likely to complete a bearish crossover, which is a negative development. Therefore we do not recommend any fresh trades.   We expected Bitcoin Cash to pull back to the downtrend line, but it turned down from $1,316.07 levels. Today, it has broken below the $1,000 support. Now, it is likely to fall to the next critical support of $854.3135. We do not find any signs of a bottom on the BCH/USD pair barring the fact that the RSI is close to entering into the oversold territory. Despite this, we want to see some buying emerge before making any trade on it. Ripple is also retesting the lows formed on February 2. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, it has still not fallen below the February 2 low of $0.63252. This points to likely exhaustion of selling in the XRP/USD pair. Also, the $0.61 is the final support. After this time, we may see a further fall to $0.24 levels. It will become positive in the short-term after it breaks out of the downtrend line. Until then, all pullbacks are likely to be sold by the bears.          Stellar could not build on the sharp pullback of February 2. It has again broken below the support of $0.41 and is likely to retest the critical support of $0.296. If this support breaks, the XLM/USD pair is likely to fall to the support line of the descending channel, which should offer strong support. If this level also breaks, a fall to $0.1 might take place. We recommend waiting for the trend to change from down to up before initiating any fresh positions. The pullback in Litecoin was stronger than the other cryptocurrencies because it reached close to the 20-day EMA. This shows interest in buying at the lower levels. If the bulls accumulate the price close to levels between $107 and $120 levels, it will point to a possible bottom. We might be interested in getting the LTC/USD pair if it breaks out of the $175 levels. On the other hand, if the bears succeed in breaking below the lows of February 2, a fall to the final support of $84.708 is likely. Due to this uncertainty, we do not recommend any long positions on Litecoin at the moment.   NEM is retesting the lows formed on February 2. If the bulls manage to hold the lows, a move towards the downtrend line might take place. If the lows breakdown, we are most likely to see a fall to the next support level of $0.31672. The XEM/USD pair will become positive in the short-term once it sustains above the downtrend line.    Until today, NEO had been a relative outperformer as it was still trading above the 50-day SMA. Today, it has broken below the 50-day SMA, the critical support of $93.53 and the low formed February 2. It still holds minor support at $86.143, below which it can fall to $64.83 levels. If this level also fails to hold, the NEO/USD pair can fall to $27.13, which is the target objective on the breakdown from the symmetrical triangle pattern. Considering this recent weakness, we recommend holding any trades until further notice. We had recommended a long position in EOS on dips to $9 with a stop loss of $7.4. Our profit objective was $14, but the pullback topped out at $11.25. The EOS/USD pair has again declined towards the critical support zone of $6.5 to $7.4. We expect this level to hold, but it is prudent to not take any fresh positions until the charts forecast a short-term bottom.

93,2018-02-07 20:32:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, February 7 2018","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   See if we can find signs of bullishness in the cryptocurrency market.   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After the clampdown in China and South Korea to cryptocurrency trading, there were fears that the US will also follow suit. However, the testimony of Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allayed these fears. They were much more realistic and supportive of cryptocurrencies than what the market had expected. As a result, most cryptocurrencies are currently in a sharp pullback, after days of weakness. Even after the recent plunge, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrencies will enter into a strong bull market that is forecast to be at least as strong as 2017. Let’s see if we can find signs of bullishness in the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. We had previously recommended buying Bitcoin in the range of $5,500 to $5,800 on panic selling. It came close to our buy level, but did not reach there. It bottomed out on February 6 at $6,075.04.    The cryptocurrency is finding buyers at lower levels who are using the sharp plunge in prices to buy for the long-term. So, is the downtrend over or will the market resume its fall after a short pullback? During a strong downtrend, a 1 to 3-day pullback can be expected. The counter-trend move usually faces selling at the 20-day EMA or at previous supports, which now act as resistance. The BTC/USD pair is likely to face resistance at $9,500, which was the high on February 3. Above this, a move to $9,920 can’t be ruled out, but we expect the range of $9,920 to $10,700 to act as a strong resistance. We believe that the cryptocurrency will turn down from one of the above-mentioned levels. If the retest of the lows is successful, we may add long positions for the long-term. If the lows break, we’ll have to wait for a few more days.    In our previous analysis, we expected a strong support at the $611.34 to $640 zone. Ethereum bottomed out at $565.54 on February 6.  This pullback is likely to face resistance at the current levels. If the ETH/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line, we might see a rally towards the $967 levels, where both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA converge. We anticipate a turnaround from one of these levels. If the next downward trend takes support between $770 to $640, it will indicate a bottom. However, if the bears breakdown below $565, a fall to $390 can’t be ruled out, but we consider this unlikely.   Bitcoin Cash bottomed out at $778.2021, just below the critical support of $854. However, the pullback from the lows does not instill confidence.      After the steep decline, we believe that the BCH/USD pair will enter a period of consolidation before embarking on an upward trend. The current pullback is likely to face resistance between $1150 and $1325 levels, from the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. We should turn bullish in the long-term only on a sustained move above the downtrend line. Ripple broke below its critical support of $0.61, but quickly recovered from $0.5627 levels. The pullback might face resistance at the previous support of $0.87.  Above this, the XRP/USD pair will face a strong resistance at the downtrend line. We’ll look to buy if the downward trend finds support between $0.87 and $0.61 levels. Stellar broke below the $0.296 critical support on February 6, but it did not fall to the support line of the descending channel.  Similar to the other cryptocurrencies, the XLM/USD pair is currently in a pullback, which will probably  face resistance at $0.41; this level was previously acting as strong support. We may have a positive outlook on Stellar once it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. We mentioned in our previous analysis that the recovery in Litecoin was stronger than other cryptocurrencies. While the other cryptocurrencies broke to new lows on February 6, the LTC/USD pair held on to its February 2 lows, which is a sign of strength.  If the recovery breaks out of $175, it will indicate a double bottom in the short-term, which gives it an upside target objective of $243. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has a slew of overhead resistances between $168 and $185. Hence, we anticipate a few days of range bound action between $107 and $175. We recommend looking to buy once the pair moves above $185.   NEM fell to a low of $0.36476 on February 6, close to the critical support of $0.31672.  Currently, it is close to the downtrend line, which will probably offer strong resistance. The downtrend will be over once the XEM/USD pair sustains above the downtrend line. We recommend waiting for a buy setup to form before making any purchases. We had forecast NEO to fall to $64.83 levels in our previous analysis and on February 6, it bottomed out at $63.62.  NEO has seen one of the sharpest pullbacks among the top cryptocurrencies. Still, it can face resistance between $111 and $123, from the moving averages. We’d better wait for the NEO/USD pair to hold above the $93 levels in the next leg down to start purchasing it. We had forecast that the $6.5 to $7.4 zone will act as strong support, and on February 6, EOS bottomed out at $5.7917.  Right now it is trading inside a tight descending channel. If it breaks out of the resistance line of the channel, it’ll possibly rally to the $10.7 levels, where both moving averages converge. If the EOS/USD pair holds above $7.5 levels in the next fall, we may place purchase orders.

94,2018-02-10 00:37:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 09","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   A technical analysis of cryptocurrencies price and their short-term movements.   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange Cryptocurrencies are a part of evolving technology and are still in a nascent stage.So, they are likely to remain quite volatile compared to the other matured asset classes. The early investors in cryptocurrencies were mostly technology enthusiasts who saw a future in them. After the humongous returns of 2017, more and more institutional investors want to join the party. This is changing the way the cryptocurrencies perform. In the past 90-days, the correlation between the S&P 500 and cryptocurrencies has risen sharply to 33 percent, which is way above the previous high reading of 19 percent, according to Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. The long-term average is way lower at 1 percent. 2018 has turned out to be hugely negative to both the stock market and the cryptocurrencies. Let’s see if the top coins point towards a resumption of the downtrend, similar to the S&P 500. While it is better to trade with the trend, at times, strong counter-trend rallies can also be profitable. Bitcoin is trading inside a descending channel with both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA trending down. This shows that it is in a confirmed downtrend. The current pullback is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA.  In a downtrend, when the selling is overdone, and prices reach attractive levels, it can offer a short-term trading opportunity. We believe that if the BTC/USD pair holds above the February 06 lows during the next leg down, the traders will have an opportunity to enter long positions. The ideal time to buy would be when prices break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. The profit objective of such a trade will be a move towards the resistance line of the descending channel. However, if the price breaks down and goes on to make a new low, the above-mentioned trading opportunity will be invalidated.    Ethereum plunged from $1,265 levels to $565.54 levels within nine days. The February 06 low also coincided with the support line of the descending channel.    The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, which points to the possibility of another leg down. We expect the current leg of the pullback to face resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the ETH/USD pair stays above the February 06 lows, it will point to a possible short-term bottom, which can be purchased. We should avoid the trade if the cryptocurrency sinks to new lows.   Yesterday, Bitcoin Cash made a strong move up. It is now likely to move towards the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA where it might face strong resistance.      The BCH/USD pair will become positive in the short-term once it breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line. We expect it to form a bullish setup in the next few days. The first target objective is a move to $2,072 levels. We currently don’t find any bullish pattern; hence, we do not recommend any trade on it.   Ripple has caused a lot of heartburn to its investors. At the current price, it is still down about 67 percent from its peak. It has been trading in a small range for the past five days and is not finding much interest among the buyers.  However, we believe that if the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line, we can expect it to attract further buying, which can propel it towards the overhead resistance of $1.74. Therefore, we need to wait for a breakout above the 20-day EMA before buying. Our view of a short-term bottom will prove to be wrong if the cryptocurrency breaks down of the lows formed on February 06.          Stellar has become range bound for the past three days. Intraday, it is facing resistance at the previous support of $0.41.  A break above this level will again face selling at the resistance line of the descending channel. The trend on the XLM/USD pair will change only after it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. Stellar will become negative if it sustains below $0.30 levels. Litecoin is close to the 20-day EMA, which has acted as strong resistance on two previous occasions.  If the bulls break out of this level, they are likely to face another round of selling around the $175 mark, which has dual resistance, from the downtrend line and the horizontal line. Once the LTC/USD pair breaks out of these resistances, it will probably start a new uptrend, which can carry it to $243 and after that to $307. Traders can initiate long positions once the cryptocurrency breaks out and sustains above the $175 levels. We don’t have a specific stop loss position. We can update the same one once our buy levels are triggered. Cardano is not finding buyers. It continues to struggle near the lows formed on February 02. It has also formed a descending triangle pattern, which is a bearish setup.    If the ADA/BTC pair breaks down and sustains below the horizontal support of 0.00004070, it will complete the descending triangle formation. After that, it will most likely slide to 0.0000246 levels where buying should emerge. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks out and closes above the downtrend line of the triangle.    NEO is facing resistance at the moving averages, as outlined in our previous analysis. Additionally, it formed an inside day pattern yesterday, February 08, and it is likely to repeat the same pattern today.  These successive inside day patterns have the same effect as the coiling of the spring. Once the bulls breakout above $120 levels, a quick rally to the downtrend line at $140 might take place. Traders can keep an initial stop loss of $100, which can be trailed higher to reduce the risk. On the other hand, if the NEO/USD pair breaks down instead of breaking out, it will become negative, and a retest of the February 06 lows is likely. EOS has broken out of the descending channel, which points to a waning bearish momentum. However, it has been facing resistance close to the $8.97 mark for a couple of days. A break above this level is likely to propel the cryptocurrency higher towards $10 and then to $12.  Very short-term traders can initiate a long position in the EOS/USD pair at $9 and keep an SL of $7.5. Still, this is a very risky trade; traders should use only 50 percent of their usual allocation.

95,2018-02-12 23:42:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 12","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Cryptocurrencies are going up, have you placed your orders already?   The cryptocurrency market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. While a buy and hold strategy has proven to be beneficial to the early Bitcoin investors, the late entrants have used the wild price swings to add to their Bitcoin numbers. We can see from the charts in this article that the whales have increased their Bitcoin holdings over the past couple of years. In these price swings, an average trader buys at the highs and sells at the lows. We have been trying to help our readers avoid this pitfall. All along through this fall, we have refrained from suggesting aggressive long positions. But, do we find a short-term bottom now? Let’s see. We were expecting Bitcoin to retest the lows after turning down from the trendline. But the bears could not break below the $8,000 mark.   Currently, the price is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line and above it, at the 20-day EMA. We expect the $8,600 to $9,400 levels to be a real test for the bulls. If they succeed in breaking out of this zone, a quick rally to $12,000 might take place, where it will again face resistance from the 50-day SMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. Therefore, the traders can wait for a breakout above $9,500 to buy. The stop loss for the trade should be kept at $7,800. The profit objective is a move to $12,000. And what if the BTC/USD pair fails to break out of $9,500 and turns down once again? In this case, traders should wait, resisting the urge to buy at lower levels because if the price breaks below $7,800, we might see it go down to the $7,000 point. We always provide both the bullish and bearish scenarios because the traders should be aware of what to expect in both cases. It would be irresponsible to provide levels only in one turn of events.    After a two-day dip on Feb. 10 and Feb. 11, Ethereum is also attempting to move up.   The ETH/USD pair is likely to face resistance at $911 from the 20-day EMA and at $980 from the 50-day SMA. Above these levels, the price may move to the resistance line of the descending channel, at about $1,050 levels. On the downside, $775 has strong support. It doesn’t provide good risk to reward ratio, so we are not suggesting a trade on it. Bitcoin Cash has been trading in a small range for the past four days. It might resolve with a large range day, either to the upside or downside.     If the large range day goes downside, we’d better avoid doing anything. But if the BCH/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, it will signal a short-term bottom, which can be traded. Therefore, we think a long position at $1,400 with a stop loss of $1,100 might be a smart move. The profit objective of this trade is a rally to the $1,925 - $2,000 levels.   We had written about the possibility of a short-term bottom in Ripple. We have been waiting for a rally above the 20-day EMA to initiate long positions. On Feb. 10, the XRP/USD pair broke out of the 20-day EMA but could not sustain higher levels. Right now, it is again at the 20-day EMA. We believe that if the bulls sustain above the $1.1 levels for four hours, we can expect a rally towards the 50-day SMA at $1.5. If this level is crossed, a move to $1.74 is likely. The traders can keep a stop loss at the $0.86 levels, which is just below the previous support. Ripple has been an underperformer in the current fall, hence, please trade with only 50 percent of the usual position size.          Stellar has continued its range-bound trading action for the past few days. Attempts to rally have been facing strong resistance at the $0.41 levels. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the descending channel, we anticipate a rally to the $0.63 levels. We don’t find any long trade until the XLM/USD pair trades inside the channel. On the downside, if the cryptocurrency breaks down of $0.3 on a closing basis (as per UTC), it can slide to the support line of the channel. Therefore, we’d better wait for a breakout of the channel to initiate any long positions. We had advised on long positions in Litecoin if the breakout sustains above the $175 levels. However, for the past three days, the bulls have been struggling to clear the 20-day EMA hurdle. If the price breaks out of $175, it will clear the resistance from the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line, and the horizontal line. We believe that this is a significant development. That’s we reiterate our recommendation to initiate long positions if the LTC/USD pair holds above the $178 levels for four hours. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $130. On the upside, $200 is resistance. If the cryptocurrency struggles at this level, we should close the position or tighten the stops. Once the bulls break out of $200, we might see a rally to $307. Cardano continues to trade inside the descending triangle pattern. This is a bearish setup, and a breakdown of the support at 0.00004070 will complete the pattern.   Though the target of this breakdown is way lower, we expect the ADA/BTC pair to find buying support at the 0.0000246 levels. Failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. Therefore, if the cryptocurrency turns up and breaks out of the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA, we need to reverse our position and go long. Until then, consider staying away from it.    In our previous analysis, we had recommended a long position on NEO above $120 levels with a stop loss of $100.   Though the price reached an intraday high of $120.33 on Feb. 10, it could not settle at the levels. Therefore, traders should wait for the price to sustain for at least four hours before buying the breakouts. On the downside, $93.53 again acted as strong support yesterday, Feb. 11. The NEO/USD pair is stuck in a range of $93.5 on the downside and $120 on the upside. A breakout of this range is likely to propel the cryptocurrency towards the downtrend line of the descending triangle. Traders can buy on a breakout above $121 if the price sustains the level for at least four hours. The initial stop loss should be kept at $93, which should be trailed higher if the bulls fail to break out of the triangle downtrend line. But in case, if the NEO turns down from the moving averages and breaks down of the $93.53 levels, it might become negative. We had recommended a short-term trade on EOS at $9 with a target objective of $10 and $12. The cryptocurrency came very close to our target as it topped out at $9.9 on Feb. 10. Hope the traders trailed their stops higher and closed out the trade at least at breakeven prices. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the 20-day EMA is trending down. It is likely to offer strong resistance at the $10 levels. On the downside, the $7.5 to $6.5 levels will act as strong support. We don’t find any reliable trade setups at the current levels, so no suggestions on new trades with the EOS/USD pair.

96,2018-02-14 14:57:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Partners With Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority To Offer Pilot Program For Banks,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Ripple and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority have announced a partnership to form a pilot program for cross-border payments with Saudi Arabian banks. News Ripple has announced an agreement today, Feb. 14, with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to provide support for Ripple’s cross-border payments technology to banks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). SAMA and Ripple have created a pilot program to provide support to KSA banks to use xCurrent, Ripple’s enterprise software solution that enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking. The first of its kind to be launched by a central bank, the pilot program will allow participating KSA banks to use xCurrent for cross-border payment payments. SAMA will support KSA banks with a regulatory sandbox, program management and training. Dilip Rao, Ripple’s global head of infrastructure innovation, said: “Central banks around the world are leaning into Blockchain technology in recognition of how it can transform cross-border payments, resulting in lower barriers to trade and commerce for both corporates [sic] and consumers.” Rao added, “SAMA is leading the charge as the first central bank to provide resources to domestic banks that want to enable instant payments using Ripple’s innovative blockchain solution.” Ripple has partnerships with over 100 financial institutions, most recently last week partnering with LianLian International, a China-based payment services provider.

97,2018-02-14 23:03:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, February 14 2018","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   The cryptomarket stands strong, with all top 9 coins moving up. The question is how high?   The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Regulators around the world are trying to stifle the popularity of cryptocurrencies. But every time they do this, the crypto world bounces back bigger and stronger than ever before. Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of Kraken, believes that the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies will more than double from the current levels and reach the $1 trillion USD milestone by the end of the year. However, as the market matures, it will start differentiating between cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse believes that many will sink to zero because they don’t have anything worthwhile to offer. But is there no way to stop the pump and dump that is the usual feature in some of the smaller coins? Lon Wong, president of NEM, believes that nothing much can be done about price manipulation until the market matures. As traders, we always keep a protective stop loss to safeguard our capital and because the crypto markets are open 24/7, the risks of a gap down opening are nonexistent. So, our readers need not worry even if prices of a few cryptocurrencies drop to zero. Let’s see if we find bullish setups on any of the top 9 coins. Bitcoin is attempting to extend its recovery, but it is likely to face a strong resistance from the current levels to the $9,500 mark, from the downtrend line, the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance.    There are two possibilities – the price will either break out or turn down from here. Do we know for sure which one will happen? No. So, we should be ready for both scenarios. If the BTC/USD pair breaks out of $9,500 and sustains for four hours, it confirms a breakout and we recommend long positions with a stop loss of $7,800. Our first target is a move to the 50-day SMA, which currently is at about $11,780. Above this, we might see a move to the resistance line of the descending channel. Secondly, if the price turns down from $9,500 and breaks below $7,800, a slide to $7,000 is likely. As we don’t have a confirmation of a bottom yet, it is recommended to keep the position size only 50 percent of usual.     Ethereum formed an inside day candlestick pattern yesterday, February 13. Today, it is trying to extend the pullback.    The recovery looks strong as the ETH/USD pair has not given up much ground since bottoming out on February 6, at $565.54. Overhead resistance is at the 20-day EMA at $902 and the 50-day SMA at $985, whereas support is at $775. Aggressive traders can initiate long positions once the price sustains above $902 for four hours. The positions should be closed at the 50-day SMA, if the cryptocurrency struggles to break out of it, else a move to the resistance line of the descending channel, around the $1,050 to $1,100 mark might happen. Since the large range move on February 8, Bitcoin Cash has been trading in a small range. As most cryptocurrencies are showing signs of a recovery, we expect this consolidation to resolve on the upside.      The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies. Therefore, we want to take this trade. Currently, the price has broken out of the downtrend line and the descending channel, but it is yet to clear the 20-day EMA, which is at $1,351. We recommend a buy at $1,400. The up move can extend to the 50-day SMA at $1,860 and thereafter to $2,000. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $1,100.   Ripple has been trading in a tight range for the past four days. It is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA. If it breaks out of this, we expect it to gain momentum.  Therefore, we had recommended a long position on the XRP/USD pair in our previous analysis. We reiterate our buy call because with most of the cryptocurrencies moving up, we believe that a rally to $1.50 and thereafter to $1.74 is possible. However, we recommend buying only after the digital currency sustains above $1.08 levels for four hours. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down of $0.86.          Stellar is also showing signs of a change in trend. It has broken out of the overhead resistance at $0.41 and is currently at the resistance line of the descending channel.  Once the price sustains above the channel, it will signal a change in trend and a move to $0.63 is likely. We recommend a long position on the XLM/USD pair at $0.45 with a stop loss at $0.30 on daily closing basis (as per UTC time frame). We note that the resistance at the 50-day SMA should be watched carefully. If the bulls struggle to breakout of this, it is prudent to close the position. We have been bullish on Litecoin for the past few days. We had recommended a long position in it in our previous analysis. Our trade triggered today and our readers would have entered long positions at $180. The break out above $175 has completed a short-term double bottom, which has a minimum target objective of $242.  The LTC/USD pair has cleared the immediate overhead resistance from the 50-day SMA; it is a bullish sign. The price should now rally to $242 and thereafter to $307 levels. We had previously recommended a stop loss of $130. However, post the breakout, the stops should be raised to $140. We’d better keep trailing the stops higher because we don’t want to hang on to the trade if it falls back below $175. Cardano is not finding any buyers. It is looking weak and a breakdown from the bearish descending triangle pattern looks possible.    The price has broken down of the critical support of 0.00004070. Unless the bulls quickly climb above this level, there might be a fall to the next support level of 0.0000246. Our bearish view on the ADA/BTC pair will be invalidated if the price breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle.    NEO has reached the critical overhead resistance of $120 from where it has returned on three previous occasions. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of this level, we might see a move towards the downtrend line of the descending triangle pattern.     We retain our recommendation for a buy call given on the NEO/USD pair in our previous analysis. Traders can go long once the price sustains above $121 for four hours. The stop loss can be kept at $100. Target objective is a rally to $140. EOS has reached a critical resistance zone of $9.8 to $10.6. In this zone, it has resistance from the 20-day EMA, the 50-day SMA and the downtrend line.  The EOS/USD pair will change its trend once it breaks out of the downtrend line. Until then, we are unable to recommend any reliable trades in it. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange; the charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

98,2018-02-15 14:55:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Western Union Confirms Testing Ripple Technology For Money Transfers,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Western Union has confirmed testing transactions based on Ripple’s Blockchain to provide faster and cheaper domestic and cross-border transfers. News The financial services provider Western Union (WU) is testing transactions with the use of Ripple’s (XRP) Blockchain-based settlement system, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal said in an interview with Bloomberg Feb. 14. The globally known money transfer company Western Union confirmed that it is testing Ripple following more than a month of rumor-fuelled speculation that began in early January. The announcement comes after Western Union reported its 2017 results, claiming a revenue of $1.4 bln - a 5 percent increase over the previous year. As Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Bloomberg, WU has decided to look into their platform in order to facilitate money transfers, particularly cross-border ones. Garlinghouse explained their choice by claiming that Ripple allows for transactions that are “a thousand times faster and a thousand times cheaper than Bitcoin’s.” According to Bloomberg, Western Union’s Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek also confirmed that testing is taking place during a conference call Tuesday, Feb. 13. “We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,” Ersek said, adding “we do have some tests with Ripple.” Ripple (XRP) is a Blockchain-based settlement protocol and a cryptocurrency that has reached almost half of Bitcoin’s market capitalization in early January 2018, when its price rallied to over $3.00 per coin. By the middle of January, however, the XRP price has bounced back to a little over $1.00. Wednesday, Feb. 14, Cointelegraph reported on a partnership signed between Ripple and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to provide the technology for cross-border payments to banks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

99,2017-10-02 19:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 2","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Japan and Singapore are taking over Chinese traders. What will happen to the prices? See to find out.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The Chinese traders don’t want to miss the action in trading cryptocurrencies. Therefore, they are moving over to Hong Kong as the Chinese exchanges shut down. Elsewhere, Japan, South Korea and the US are moving ahead with steps that will promote the digital currency markets. As a result of these positive steps, the virtual currencies continue their march higher. So, has the pullback run its course or is there more steam left? Let’s see. Traders who followed our previous recommendations would have entered long positions around $3,900 and $4,120, levels marked on the chart via ellipse. Though both the positions are in profit and our target objective is $4,680, we recommend selling about 30 percent of the position at the current levels of $4,418 and raising the stop loss on the rest to $4,000.  That way, our entire remaining position will become risk-free and we will also pocket some profit. Our first target objective is $4,680, where we shall book profits on another 20 percent of the position because we expect some resistance to creep in. If Bitcoin breaks out of the $4,680 levels, it is likely to retest the highs, where we plan to book profits on the remaining 50 percent of our original position. On a fall, the digital currency will find support in the $4,000 to $4,165 zone. Once $4,000 level breaks, the virtual currency can extend its fall to $3,850 and thereafter to $3,600 levels. We don’t have any live trades in Ethereum. The digital currency has been consolidating in a tight range of about $280 to $310 for the past seven days. This tight range will soon resolve itself either to the upside or downside.  If the cryptocurrency breaks out of $317 levels, it will gain momentum and quickly rally to $344, where we expect some resistance to creep in. If this level is crossed, then a move to $400 to $420 levels is likely. Therefore, we recommend buying at $317. However, if Ethereum breaks down of the uptrend line, it will invalidate the bullish pattern and a move to lower levels of $255 is likely. Therefore, we want to keep a stop loss just below the trendline at $275 once our buy levels are triggered. We recommend tightening the stop loss if the virtual currency struggles to breakout of $344 levels. The level of interest in Bitcoin Cash has dwindled down, which has resulted in a range bound action in the last few days. The cryptocurrency is even finding it difficult to rally to the highs of the range.  For the past few days it has remained in the lower half of the range. Therefore, we don’t recommend any trading positions in Bitcoin Cash. We shall resume trading in Bitcoin Cash if it breaks out of the range or if it strengthens the range with two touches on the upper end of the range and two bounces off the lower end of the range. Ripple is testing our patience, as it has been range bound for the past five days. Our long positions are at a marginal loss. We want to raise our stop loss to $0.18500 levels because if the digital currency breaks down of the small uptrend line, it can correct to $0.16600 levels.  The cryptocurrency will gain strength above $0.22000 levels. Our target objective remains $0.25000. We don’t see any pattern developing on ripple. Therefore, lackluster trading is likely to continue for a few more days. We don’t have any trades on Litecoin because it never reached our buy levels of $58.  The digital currency did not breakout of the ascending triangle. The pattern is now invalid as the price has broken down of the uptrend line. Litecoin is likely to remain in the range of $44 and $57. We have two trade recommendations on Litecoin. First is a buy at $58 with a stop loss of $50, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the range. However, if Litecoin falls to the lower end of range before breaking out of it, we shall buy around $44 and keep an SL of $40. For this trade, our target objective is $57.

Japan is unperturbed with its neighbor’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies. While Chinese exchanges are stopping trading from this month’s end, Japan has granted 11 cryptocurrency exchange licenses. In the US, Keith Noreika, acting comptroller of the currency for the U.S. Treasury Department has said that Bitcoin companies might be granted “fintech charters” in the future. He also said that he was open to the idea of the banks conducting their business in cryptocurrencies. This shows that while one nation is closing its doors to cryptocurrencies, others are warming up to it. Let’s see if this news can boost cryptocurrencies higher. Though Bitcoin triggered our buy at $4120 levels, it could not sustain the rally and plunged to $4018.32. Nevertheless, lower levels attracted buying, again bringing Bitcoin to the verge of breaking out of the ascending triangle pattern, which is a bullish development.  The minimum target objective of a breakout from the triangle is $5358, however, we shall go one step at a time. On a breakout above $4280, the currency is likely to rally to $4680, where we recommend selling half of one’s position. The other half can be held with a close stop, because above $4680 the digital currency can quickly rally to $5000 levels. Traders who are long on our previous recommendations should keep a stop loss of $3750. They can tighten their stops further to $4000 once the digital currency rallies above $4280. We shall keep trailing the stops higher as the market moves in our favor. Ethereum did not trigger our buy levels, because we had recommended a long position only if the digital currency closed above $312 and the highest closing in the last three days was $309.61.  Once it was clear that Ethereum wouldn’t breakout, sellers emerged. As a result, Ethereum plunged to $278.88, close to the trendline. If the digital currency breaks below the trendline, it is likely to fall to $255 and to $235 levels. Therefore, we want to initiate a long position only on a confirmation of a resumption of the uptrend. We now recommend a long position at $317. Traders should keep their stop loss at $270 and the target objective is $420. However, there is significant resistance at $344. Therefore, traders should tighten their stop loss if the digital currency struggles to breakout of this resistance. Bitcoin Cash is range bound between $385 and $549. Within this range, the cryptocurrency is likely to remain volatile. Therefore, we shall buy it only after it breaks out of the range. Until then, we will stick to the other cryptocurrencies that are trending.  However, for traders who want to trade Bitcoin Cash only, they can buy once the digital currency bounces from the lower end of the range at $385. Profits should be booked at the upper end of the range at $549. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $350 because if the digital currency breaks down of this level, it can sink to $300. Ripple could not continue higher after breaking out of the resistance at $0.19537. It fell to $0.18800 levels where buying emerged.  As a result, the digital currency has again broken out of $0.19537. We expect the currency to gain momentum once it breaks out of $0.22000 levels. Traders who are long on our previous recommendation should maintain their stop loss at $0.16500. They should raise the stops to $0.18500 once Ripple breaks out of $0.22000. The target objective is $0.25000. Litecoin did not reach our buy levels, therefore, no trade was triggered. The cryptocurrency fell close to $50 levels where it found buying support.  If Litecoin breaks above $58, it is likely to start a new uptrend which could carry it to $72 levels. Therefore, traders can buy at $58 and keep a stop loss at $44. Once the currency breaks out of $64 the stop loss can be increased to $50.   *This article was written Sept 29, 7 p.m. UTC   ",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-ripple-litecoin-price-analysis-september-29,0.17657657657657658,-0.11531531531531532,0,0

Mike Novogratz, the ex-macro manager at Fortress Investment Group believes there is a huge opportunity in cryptocurrencies. He reportedly plans to launch a $500 mln hedge fund, investing $150 mln of his own money into the fund, which is likely to start by the end of this year. He said that he sold his Bitcoins around $4,980 and again bought closer to $3,000 levels. But, what should we do? Let’s see. After breaking out of the downtrend line, Bitcoin consolidated in a small range Sept. 26. However, today, Sept. 27, it has resumed its upmove. $4,113.15 is the final resistance, above which, the digital currency will resume a new uptrend, which can carry it to $4,680 levels. There is a small resistance at $4,380; however, we expect it to be crossed easily. Aggressive traders who initiated long on our previous recommendation should maintain their stop loss at $3,500. New positions can be added once the digital currency breaks out and closes above $4,120. The downtrend line should offer support on any fall. Therefore, once Bitcoin breaks out of $4,120, stops can be raised to $3,750. Traders should use less than 50 percent of their usual position size. We expect bears to offer a stiff resistance at higher levels. Ethereum continues to trade within the ascending triangle, which will complete on a breakout of $311. This bullish setup has a target objective of $420. The pattern will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down of the uptrend line. The breakdown can sink Ethereum to $240 levels. Within the triangle, the cryptocurrency is likely to be volatile. Therefore, we recommend a long position only on a breakout and close above $312. The SL can be kept just below the uptrend line at $260. Though the pattern target is $420, Ethereum may face selling pressure at $344. Therefore, traders should tighten their stop loss if the digital currency struggles to breakout of $344.   Bitcoin Cash is not showing any trend. It is likely to be range-bound between $385 and $549. It will become bullish only when it sustains above the $549 levels. Therefore, we prefer to trade other cryptocurrencies, which are forming a bullish setup.   Nevertheless, traders who want to trade Bitcoin Cash can buy at the lower end of the range at $385 with a stop loss of $350. They should book profits at the upper end of the range at $549. A fall and close below $385 can sink Bitcoin Cash to $300 levels. Ripple has broken out of the overhead resistance of $0.19537. It should now rally to $0.25000 levels. Therefore, traders can enter long positions at the current levels and on any dips towards $0.20000 levels and keep a stop loss of $0.16500. However, this is a high-risk trade because Ripple is not in an uptrend. It is forming a large bearish descending triangle pattern. Therefore, please keep the position size 50 percent of normal. After the sharp fall, Litecoin has become range bound between $44 and $57.729. If the digital currency breaks out of this range, it will start a new uptrend, which has a minimum pattern target of $72. The traders can buy on a breakout and close above $58. The initial stop loss can be kept at $44, which can be raised once the cryptocurrency moves higher. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout of $58, it is likely to remain volatile within the range. Therefore, please buy only on a breakout.

China has banned ICOs and has ended cryptocurrency trading opportunities on the Chinese exchanges. However, it is moving ahead with steps to study the Blockchain technology in detail to issue its own digital currency. Beijing should “accelerate the process of launching a sovereign digital currency after it curbed risks of cryptocurrencies,” said an opinion piece published in the Financial News, the mouthpiece of the People’s Bank of China(PBOC). However, with credit rating agencies recently downgrading China’s sovereign rating, it is unlikely that a digital currency issued by the PBOC will displace Bitcoin or Ethereum. Bitcoin has been trading in a small range for the past two days. It is facing resistance at the 3,800 levels. Today, even if the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line, it is unlikely to race away towards the highs. It will face resistance from the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $3,886.  Thereafter, the next resistance zone is between $4,050 and $4,120 levels. Unless Bitcoin breaks out of this, it is likely to remain range-bound and volatile. Nevertheless, a breakout of the downtrend line will change the trend from down to range bound. On the downside, the digital currency has a strong support at $3,500 levels. A breakdown of this level can push the cryptocurrency back towards the lows of $2,974. Currently, we don’t find a buy setup with a good risk to reward ratio. Nevertheless, aggressive traders can look for buying opportunities once Bitcoin breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. The initial stop loss can be kept at 3,500, which can be raised later. The position size shouldn’t be more than 25 percent of the normal. If Bitcoin gains momentum, additional positions can be added above $4,120 levels. The first target objective on the upside is $4,680, above which a retest of the lifetime highs is likely. Ethereum is attempting to move higher. It has broken out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. It has also formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $311. The pattern target on a breakout of the triangle is $420.  However, the digital currency will have to sustain above the uptrend line to keep the formation intact. If Ethereum breaks below the uptrend line, it will invalidate the pattern, sinking the digital currency to $235 levels. We don’t find any trade as long as the cryptocurrency trades inside the triangle. We recommend a long position on a breakout and close above $312, SL $260 and target $420. Traders should enter long positions only on a confirmed close above the overhead resistance. $344 might act as a resistance; however, we expect this level to be crossed. Bitcoin Cash firmly remains below the downtrend line. It hasn’t done much in the past four days. $400 has acted as a strong support, however, lack of buying at higher levels has resulted in small range days.  As Bitcoin Cash is not showing any trend, we don’t have a recommendation on it. We shall consider it only after it sustains above the downtrend line for three days or breaks out of $550. Ripple is not showing any trend. It is stuck in a tight range between $0.15000 and $0.19300. We don’t find any trade within this range.  If ripple breaks out of $0.20000, aggressive traders can initiate long positions with a target objective of $0.25000. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $0.15000. Nevertheless, please don’t allocate more than 25 percent of the usual position size on this trade, because it is a low conviction setup. On the lower side, $0.15000 and $0.13500 are the two critical supports to watch out for. Litecoin has held the critical support of $45. However, it is struggling to move higher.  It is likely to break out of the downtrend line. However, it will not become positive until it breaks out of the $60 levels. It is likely to remain range-bound between $45 and $57 for the next few days. Therefore, we are not recommending a trade on it. Critical levels to watch out are $60 on the upside and $45 on the downside.

Bitcoin has entered a bear market and most of the news around it has turned bearish. Experts are speculating about the future of cryptocurrencies and what can be done to reduce the volatility. However, we believe that a 30 percent fall after such a stupendous rally this year should not come as a surprise. There have been many such corrections in Bitcoin’s journey to $5,000 and investors who had the stomach to sit through it have been rewarded handsomely. Nevertheless, it’s difficult for many to digest this volatility and they prefer to trade the short-term swings. For such traders, we provide critical levels that can be kept in mind while initiating a trade. Let’s see the latest recommendations. After the sharp fall, Bitcoin’s recovery hit a roadblock around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $4,975 to $2,974. Additionally, the downtrend line has offered resistance twice. Therefore, it also becomes a strong resistance point. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) are also on the verge of a bearish crossover. All these indicate that Bitcoin is in a downtrend. So, how far can the cryptocurrency fall? Bitcoin has a strong support at $3,500 levels, from where it has risen on Sept. 16 and 17. If this level breaks, then the final support is at $3,409, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the pullback from $2,974 to $4,113.15. Below this level, the digital currency is likely to retest the lows at $2,974. Bitcoin is volatile. It turns around in a jiffy. What are the levels to watch out for if it turns around? The first bullish sign is a breakout and closes above the downtrend line. This is where the aggressive traders should initiate long positions. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please keep the allocation size small. Long positions can be added once Bitcoin breaks out and closes above $4,113.15. Traders should refrain from buying on dips because a breakdown below $2,974 will be very bearish. We had predicted Ethereum to fall to $240 in our previous analysis, which has materialized. What next? If the digital currency breaks below $240, it is likely to fall to $223 levels, which is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $200.15 to $310.7. If this level also breaks, then the digital currency will retest the lows at $200. First signs of a recovery will be when the digital currency breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. Nevertheless, the rally is likely to face resistance from the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Ethereum is likely to gain strength only above $312 levels. Therefore, traders should wait for a breakout above $312 to initiate any long positions. We were correct in predicting a fall to $400 levels on Bitcoin Cash if it failed to breakout of the downtrend line. Now, if it breaks below the $400 support, it can fall to $357 and thereafter to $300 levels. Bitcoin Cash is in a strong downtrend since topping out at $972 on Aug. 19. Therefore, even if it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line, we advise against initiating long positions until the digital currency breaks out of $550. Ripple is likely to retest the lows at $0.15000 once again. Any recovery is likely to face resistance at the $0.19300 and the $0.20000 levels. We don’t see any buy setups even if the digital currency breaks out of $0.20000 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on ripple until we see a clear trend. Litecoin is in a strong downtrend. If it doesn’t find support at $45, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the pullback from $32.681 to $57.729, it is likely to fall to $42 and after that to $38 levels. Litecoin will not be out of the woods until it breaks out and sustains above $60 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it.

The rebound in the cryptocurrencies has hit a wall following a slew of negative headlines. Today, we should get some insight into the Fed’s plans to shrink its massive balance sheet. This news will affect the US dollar and can also influence the cryptocurrencies. These are uncertain times; therefore, we suggest traders cut their position size in half to limit their risk. Bitcoin has been facing resistance at the $4,100 levels, according to our expectation.  Between $4,000 and $4,100, there is a confluence of resistance from both the moving averages and the downtrend line. The 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $4,975 to $2,974 is also just below the $4,000 levels. Therefore, we had avoided recommending any trade in our previous analysis. However, after consolidating for three days, if Bitcoin breaks out of this resistance zone, we expect it to gain momentum on the upside. Though there is a minor resistance at $4,210 - the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level - we expect this resistance to be crossed. The next major resistance is at $4,680, after which a retest of the highs is likely. Therefore, we recommend buying Bitcoin on a breakout above $4,120. However, before initiating long positions, the traders should watch for an hour or two to confirm that the breakout is sustaining. The stop loss can be maintained at $3,660 initially. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of $4,210, the stops can be raised to $3,800. Traders should similarly trail their stops higher to reduce their risk. Partial profits can be booked at $4,600 levels. Remaining positions can be sold closer to $5,000 levels. On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to breakout of the overhead resistance, it will retrace the recent bounce from the lows and is likely to fall to $3,500 levels. Ethereum also performed according to our expectations. It is facing stiff resistance from both the moving averages and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $409.42 to $200.15.  A breakout of the resistance zone of $275 to $310 will indicate strength. Therefore, traders can buy above $312 and keep a stop loss of $250. There is a minor resistance zone between $329 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level) and $344. If the digital currency struggles to breakout of these levels, traders should raise their stops to breakeven. However, if these levels are crossed, a move to $409 is likely. On the other hand, if the digital currency is unable to breakout of the overhead resistance, it can fall to $240 levels, which is a significant support. Bitcoin Cash has been hovering around the $500 mark for the past two days.  It has been facing resistance from the downtrend line. However, a breakout and close above the downtrend line can propel the digital currency towards the $700 levels. Therefore, the traders can initiate long positions at $550 and keep a stop loss at $400. If, however, the cryptocurrency returns from the downtrend line, it can fall to $400 levels.   Ripple has not been able to breakout of the critical overhead resistance of $0.19300.  The digital currency remains bearish until it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle. It has support at $0.15000 and $0.13500 levels. Notwithstanding, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the downtrend line, it will indicate a change in trend. Failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. However, we don’t find any buy setups. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on Ripple. Litecoin is facing resistance at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $93.649 to $32.681.  The cryptocurrency will change its trend only on a breakout above the downtrend line and the overhead resistance at $60. Until the digital currency trades below these levels, it remains weak. We don’t find any reliable buy setups on Litecoin thus we remain neutral on it.

Last week, cryptocurrencies plunged following news of the Chinese crackdown. Though the fall was sharp, it was short lived. Lower levels gave an opportunity to the eager bulls to make an entry. So, has the correction ended and will digital currencies again resume their gravity-defying run? Should you jump in right away or will the cryptocurrencies retest last week’s lows? Let’s look at the charts and find out. We expected Bitcoin to pullback to about $3200 levels, but it never dipped below $3500.05. This shows that there is enough buying support at lower levels.  Nevertheless, after the pullback of the past four days, the digital currency has reached the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $4975 to $2974, which should act as a resistance. Additionally, Bitcoin is likely to face resistance between the $3955 and $4100 levels, from both the moving averages and the downtrend line. We don’t expect the digital currency to climb back to its lifetime highs in a hurry. We expect some kind of a consolidation or a minor pullback towards the recent lows once again. However, if the price continues to rally and breaks out of both the moving averages and the downtrend line, we will throw in the towel and quit looking for a pullback. Ethereum never pulled back to our buy levels of $220. The lowest it fell to was $238.98 levels yesterday. The digital currency has broken out of the descending channel, which is a positive sign.  Currently, Ethereum has reached close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $409.42 to $200.15, which should offer stiff resistance. Additionally, we expect the digital currency to face resistance from both of the moving averages. However, if the next pullback doesn’t fall below $250 levels, it will indicate significant strength and we shall look for buying opportunities. However, we don’t find any attractive buy setups at the current levels. Bitcoin Cash has bounced a whopping 64 percent from its lows. Currently, it is likely to face resistance from the 50-period simple moving average (SMA), and the psychological barrier of $500. Above the moving average, the cryptocurrency can rally to the downtrend line at about $580 levels.  On the other hand, if the digital currency is unable to breakout above $500, it can fall to $400 levels. As we don’t find any attractive setups, we are not recommending a trade on it.   Ripple has pulled back close to $0.19300, where it has a confluence of resistances from the moving averages and the downtrend line.  We shall change our view only after a breakout and close above the downtrend line of the descending triangle. Until then, we remain neutral on Ripple. Even after the pullback from the lows, Litecoin is currently trading below both the moving averages and the downtrend line. It has a number of resistances between the $56 and $68 levels.  Therefore, we believe that the risk to reward ratio is not favorable to enter long positions now. We shall wait for a suitable set up to form before recommending any trade. Note from the author:Though all the top five cryptocurrencies have rebounded sharply from their lows, we expect some kind of a consolidation or correction within the next few days. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade today as buying at the current levels is risky.

Don’t miss the latest analytical overview on prices.   BTC China has decided to shut down operations by Sept. 30. The first reaction by harried traders on such announcements is to sell and encash their holdings. Therefore, the sharp fall is understandable. Does this mean that traders around the world should also panic? No, because after the initial selling subsides, aggressive bulls will start buying at important support levels. Should we also join the early buyers or should we wait for more confirmation before initiating long positions? Let’s see. Bitcoin has completed a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $1,752 to $4,975. Aggressive buyers have taken advantage of the sharp fall and have initiated long positions close to $2,970 levels, which is a crucial support.  Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will quickly rally $5,000 levels because the bears will again short at higher levels. We expect selling pressure at the $3,800 levels, closer to the downtrend line. Therefore, we recommend waiting for another successful retest of $2,970 before initiating long positions. However, aggressive traders can buy 25 percent of their allocation on dips to about $3,200 levels. The stop loss should be placed at $2,900 and the profit objective is $3,800. The digital currency is likely to remain volatile for the next few days. Therefore, traders should play for small profits.   Ethereum broke below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $129.78 to $409.42. However, strong buying support emerged closer to the $200 levels, pushing prices higher.  Nevertheless, the digital currency is trading inside a descending channel. We expect bears to sell closer to $270 levels. Therefore, we recommend waiting for a successful retest of $200 levels before buying. First signs of a bottom will form when the digital currency breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. Aggressive traders can buy closer to $220 and keep a stop loss of $190. Profits should be booked closer to $270 levels. Bitcoin Cash completed a 100 percent retracement of the rally from $296.38 to $972. $300 is a strong support, which has held for now. However, we expect selling close to the downtrend line.  Any long position should be initiated only after a successful retest of $300 levels. We prefer to buy the leaders because they are likely rebound more than Bitcoin Cash.   We were short on ripple and our first target objective of $0.15000 was met. Hopefully, traders would have booked their profits.  The digital currency is currently in a pullback, which is likely to face resistance at the $0.19300 levels. If the overhead resistance holds, the cryptocurrency is likely to turn down towards $0.15000 levels once again. However, if price breaks out of the overhead resistance, it can rally to the downtrend line. We shall look for buying opportunities only after ripple breaks out of the downtrend line and $0.19300 levels. Litecoin had broken below the descending triangle pattern, which had a target of $30. Today, the digital currency came close to its target and reversed from there. Currently, it has risen about $20 from its intraday lows of the day, which shows the kind of huge volatility in it. Nevertheless, any pullback is likely to face resistance at the $60 levels. Therefore, we shall wait for lower levels before initiating any long positions. All the top five cryptocurrencies have become very volatile. Therefore, traders should reduce their allocation size by at least 50 percent to safeguard their capital. *Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin charts are provided by HitBTC exchange.

107,2017-09-13 13:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 13","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Daily analytical price overview.   Back in 2015, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had said that people trading in digital currencies such as Bitcoin were wasting their time. Notwithstanding, the lucky few who wasted their time back then would be sitting on more than 900 percent returns. What a fantastic way to waste time. Fast forward two years and Dimon has intensified his criticism of Bitcoin, calling it “a fraud” and a bubble “worse than tulip bulbs”. Nevertheless, he doesn’t want to short Bitcoin either, because he is not sure how far the bubble will expand. Let’s study the charts and try to forecast whether we should buy this correction or stay out of it. Bitcoin has extended its correction and is currently at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a crucial support. A break and close below this level is likely to exacerbate selling, which can sink the digital currency to $3363, which is a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $1752 to $4975.  However, the RSI will enter oversold territory if Bitcoin falls sharply below the 50-day SMA. Three previous oversold readings on the RSI have proven to be an excellent buying opportunity. Hence, it can be risky to short bitcoin at the current levels. On the other hand, if Bitcoin bounces from the 50-day SMA, it will face resistance at the downtrend line. We shall turn bullish only after Bitcoin stops falling and breaks out of the downtrend line. At current levels, we should remain neutral on the cryptocurrency, as we don’t find any good setups, either to go long or short. We were correct in avoiding a trade on Ethereum in our previous analysis. A short trade would have hit our stop loss above $310 and a long trade would also have hit the stop loss.  So, what next? Ethereum is comparatively weaker than Bitcoin, as it has already broken below the 50-day SMA. It is currently at a critical 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $129.78 to $409.42. A break below this crucial support can sink the digital currency to $236 levels, which is a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the upmove. However, we don’t find an attractive short trade setup, which has a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we remain neutral on Ethereum. Bitcoin Cash has broken down below the range of $523 to $736. Its next support is at $470 from where it had bounced on Sept. 5. If this level breaks, the cryptocurrency may plummet to $440.  On the other hand, if the digital currency finds support at $470, it is again likely to enter into the range. We don’t find any attractive long or short trading setups, therefore, we remain neutral on Bitcoin Cash. Ripple could not breakout of the downtrend line and rally above $0.23500, therefore, our long trade was not triggered.  The digital currency is perilously close to breaking down below $0.19300 levels that will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, which has a lower pattern target of $0.085. However, we expect $0.13500 to act as a strong support because this level has not been broken down on a closing basis since early-May of this year. We recommend a short trade on ripple on a close below $0.19000 with a stop loss of $0.22500. Please cover 50 percent of the shorts closer to $0.15000 levels, and trail the remaining position with a close stop loss.  Litecoin has broken down the descending triangle pattern. It can fall to $52 and thereafter to $41 levels. Again, a stop loss and the target objective don’t justify a short trade. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it. *Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin charts are provided by HitBTC exchange.

Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein indirectly hinted that cryptocurrencies are on their way to replacing paper money. This is in stark contrast to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has still not acknowledged the rise and acceptance of cryptocurrencies across the globe. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that at least a few major investment banks are pondering over allowing investors direct trading opportunities in cryptocurrencies. Experts are bullish on Bitcoin, expecting it to reach $6,000 by the end of this year. That is a good 42 percent above the current price of $4,200. Let’s see, whether this is a good time to enter cryptocurrencies or are they due to fall further. We had recommended taking 30 percent profits on our Bitcoin positions at $4,418. That made our existing investment in Bitcoin risk-free. So, should traders re-enter at the current levels or will Bitcoin fall further? There is a confluence of support between $4,114 to $4,170, from the 20-day exponential moving average, the 50-day simple moving average, the horizontal line, and the trendline. Therefore, we expect this support to hold, at least in the short-term. The subsequent rise from here will decide whether Bitcoin will resume its uptrend and rally above $4,500 or will it turn down and sink below $4,000. Aggressive traders, who trade for the short-term, can buy at the current levels of around $4,218 and keep a stop loss of $4,000. The target objective is $4488. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please keep the allocation size 25 percent of normal. For swing traders, please maintain the stop loss at $4,000 and don’t add any fresh positions. If Bitcoin breaks down and closes well below the trendline, it is likely to fall to $3,900 and $3,731 levels, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the pullback from $2,974 to $4,488.01. Ethereum could not breakout of the bullish ascending triangle pattern and price has moved out of the trendline, invalidating the setup. The cryptocurrency is consolidating between the $278.88 and $316.61 levels for the past few days. Both the moving averages have also flattened out, signaling a range bound action. Ethereum doesn’t have a history of forming large ranges. Therefore, we expect a breakout or breakdown of this range soon. We recommend waiting for a breakout above $317 to enter long positions. Though there is a resistance at $344, we expect the digital currency to breakout of it and rally to $354. The stop loss for this trade should be kept at $278. However, if Ethereum breaks down of $280, it is likely to extend its fall to $257.94, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $200.15 to $315.72. We have been cautious on Bitcoin Cash for the past few days and the price action has validated our stance. Should you buy this fall? In our previous analysis, we did not recommend any trade on bitcoin cash because we were not confident that the range will hold. Today, the digital currency has broken down of the range, which gives it a lower target of $221, unless Bitcoin Cash quickly reverses direction and ends the day above $385. Though we expect some buying to emerge at $300 levels, we are not recommending any trades on Bitcoin Cash. We shall wait for a bottom formation before buying it. We have carried a long position in Ripple from the past week. Ripple is sustaining above both the moving averages and the trendline support, which is a positive sign.  The digital currency will gain momentum once it breaks out of $0.22000 levels. Our target level remains at $0.25000. Traders should maintain the stop loss at $0.185000. The cryptocurrency will become negative if it breaks down and closes below the uptrend line. Until then, we remain bullish on Ripple. We have been waiting for a breakout of the range in Litecoin, which has not happened. So, should you buy at the lower end of the range? Litecoin is trading within a well-defined range of $44.160 on the lower end and $57.729 on the upper end. As the cryptocurrency was unable to breakout of the range, it is likely to fall to the lower end of the range, if it breaks down of $50. We expect the range to hold; therefore, we recommend a long position in Litecoin around $46 levels when price turns up after touching the lower end of the range at $44. Please don’t buy when the digital currency is falling. We can keep a stop loss of $40 and our target objective will be a rally to $57. On the other hand, if Litecoin holds the $50 levels and rallies above $58 levels, we expect it to start a new uptrend. Therefore, we recommend long positions at $58 with a stop loss of $49. Our target objective is $71.   ",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-ripple-litecoin-price-analysis-october-04,0.08088235294117647,-0.19607843137254902,0,0
109,2017-10-05 14:15:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple CEO Takes Swipe at Science Experiment ‘Blockchain Tourists’,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Ripple’s CEO believes that too many companies are treating Blockchain tech like a science experiment. Adoption Chief executive of cryptocurrency start-up Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has spoken out at the number of companies and people using Blockchain technology more as a buzzword, rather than creating real world use cases. The boom of ICOs has seen hundreds of new companies try and build a business on Blockchain technology, but according to Garlinghouse, many of them could be better served simply using databases. ""Blockchain is like the new big data or AI (artificial intelligence) — too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem,"" Garlinghouse said. ""We like to call them Blockchain tourists! There are many applications that are nothing more than science experiments."" Of course, Blockchain technology is the same technology that Ripple is pinned to, or for that matter, any cryptocurrency. However, Ripple can claim it has real world application, as there has been an exploration into the banking sector as Ripple focuses on banks, global payments, and digital exchange. ""Some of the uses being implemented for Blockchain could actually work better with a database,"" he added. ""There are examples out there that Blockchain is not most applicable for, and that is why Ripple is focused on a real world use case, solving a real (and very large) customer problem, which has converted into commercial traction that is unmatched in the enterprise Blockchain space."" There are a ton of start up style companies that have hopped on the bandwagon of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology, and tokenization. A lot of these have merit, but there are also many that are not worth the white paper they are written on. The boom of ICO has irked many regulators, with the likes of China taking the hardest approach to them, with Korea, and even the SEC in the USA following similar suit. However, there are some large and established traditional firms that are taking the power of the Blockchain forward leaps and bounds, as they utilize the powerful technology to alleviate problems. IBM for example has not only built a Blockchain for major global banks such as Deutsche Bank and HSBC; it also developed a Blockchain-based solution for the food ecosystem that allows producers to trace food contamination in a matter of seconds. Accounting giant EY also unveiled its own distributed ledger solution for the shipping insurance industry last month.

Similar to all markets, even in cryptocurrencies, traders continue shifting their loyalties from Bitcoin to altcoins, which results in one outperforming the other. While comparing the performance of  the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the third quarter of this year, Bitcoin has emerged as the leader, gaining 74%. Bitcoin Cash was not considered, as it did not trade for the full quarter. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum, turned out a weak performance, rising only 8% in the third quarter. This is in stark contrast to its staggering rally of 500% in the second quarter of this year. This shows that traders will make money only if they are invested in the right cryptocurrency. Let’s find the most promising one to trade now. We have carried long positions in Bitcoin for both the swing traders and the aggressive traders. Both these positions are currently in a profit. What should the traders do now?  Bitcoin has risen from the critical support levels of $4114 to $4170, according to our expectations. If the digital currency breaks out of $4488, it is likely to rally to $4680 levels. This is the last resistance before a retest of the highs at $5000. Therefore, swing traders should continue to hold their positions, but they should raise their stop loss from $4000 to $4100. They should tighten their stops further once the digital currency breaks out of $4488. The aggressive traders should book 30% of their profits at the current levels of $4387 and hold the rest with a stop loss of $4100. This will reduce their risk on the existing positions. Once Bitcoin rallies above $4488, they should again raise their stop loss to breakeven and book partial profits at $4680. Our bullish view on bitcoin will be invalidated if it turns down and breaks below $4100 levels. That can extend the fall to $3909 and $3731 levels, which are 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the pullback from $2974 to $4488.01. Ethereum has spent the past few days consolidating in a tight range. This shows an equilibrium between both the bulls and the bears. Neither party is able to overpower the other. However, this is unlikely to continue for long. One of the two will emerge as a winner.  If Ethereum breaks out of the upper end of the range at $317, it is likely to start a new uptrend, which has a pattern target of $354. Therefore, we recommend a long position on the digital currency at $317. The initial stop loss can be kept at $278, which should be raised as the cryptocurrency moves higher. The stops should be tightened further if Ethereum struggles to breakout of the overhead resistance at $344. If, however, the bears manage to push Ethereum below $278, it will open up a downside of $257.94, which is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $200.15 to $315.72. Bitcoin Cash is attempting to stabilize after breaking down of the range. However, compared to the other cryptocurrencies, it still lacks buying interest.  We have been cautious on Bitcoin Cash for the past few days. The digital currency continues to trade below both the critical moving averages and the downtrend line. This shows that it remains in a downtrend. Therefore, we don’t recommend a long trade on Bitcoin Cash. The first target on the downside is $300 if Bitcoin Cash is unable to climb above $385. On the other hand, if the cryptocurrency rallies above the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, it will signal strength. Traders who trade only Bitcoin Cash can buy at $436 and keep a stop loss of $336. The profit objective is $549. Rest of the traders are better off trading other cryptocurrencies. Our long position in Ripple continues to make gains. It is close to our target objective of $0.25000. Should traders book profits?  The downtrend line at $0.25000 is likely to offer a strong resistance. However, if the digital currency breaks out of it, a rally to $0.3000o is possible. Therefore, traders can book partial profits, about 30% at the current levels and raise the stops on the remaining position to breakeven. This will ensure that the traders pocket some profits and the remaining position becomes risk-free. They should continue to trail their stops higher if the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line. Currently, Litecoin is trading at the center of the range between $44.16 and $57.729. How can we trade it?  The best way to trade in a range is to buy at the support and sell at the resistance. However, as price is ruling at the midpoint, we don’t recommend a trade at the current levels. Nevertheless, if Litecoin breaks out of the range, it will signal strength. Therefore, we recommend a long position at $58 with a stop loss of $49. The target objective of this trade is $71. However, if the digital currency breaks below $50 and falls to $44 levels, we shall wait and watch its performance at the lows before buying it. We don’t recommend a long position at $44 anymore because of the lack of buying interest in the digital currency.

What does it mean for altcoins?   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The top two currencies by market capitalization are nearing critical updates and the market is clearly favoring one over the other. Over the weekend, traders sold the altcoins and piled on Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoin’s dominance has again crossed over the halfway mark. Will this trend continue or will the altcoins play catch up? Let’s find out. Our readers continue to benefit from the rally in Bitcoin. The upmove over the weekend has carried the cryptocurrency towards our target objective. So, should we sell out or wait?  The digital currency has reached $4680 levels, which is a major resistance. We expect a small pullback or a consolidation at these levels. Therefore, we recommend selling around 50% of the existing positions at the current levels and holding the rest with a stop loss of $4250. We don’t want to book out of our complete position because the uptrend in Bitcoin is still strong. A breakout above $4680 will push the virtual currency towards its all time highs. Therefore, we want to hold about 30 to 35% of our original position, expecting to book out around $5000. On the downside, Bitcoin has support from the trendline at $4400 levels. If this support breaks, the next major support zone is between $4150 and $4250 from both the moving averages. The outlook will become negative if it starts to trade below $4100 levels. Our long positions on Ethereum were initiated yesterday at $317. However, the position quickly turned into a loss as the cryptocurrency failed to sustain this level.  The bulls were unable to capitalize on the breakout of the range. As a result, the eager bulls, like us, are stuck with the long position. Both the moving averages are flat, suggesting continuation of the range bound action. Chances are that the cryptocurrency will now fall towards the lows of the range. Nevertheless, we shall continue to hold our position with a stop loss of $278. A breakdown and close below the range can sink Ethereum to $257 levels. The digital currency will become positive only on a breakout and close above $317. Bitcoin Cash has resumed its downtrend.  Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are moving in opposite directions. Bitcoin Cash has a major support at $300. We expect a small pullback or a consolidation close to this level. However, as the cryptocurrency is in a strong bear grip, we don’t recommend buying it. We shall consider buying the cryptocurrency only after it rallies and sustains above $385 levels. Until then, we shall stick to trading the other cryptocurrencies that have a bullish chart pattern. Our long positions continue to gain as Ripple rallies towards our second target objective of $0.30000. We had booked 30% profits in our long positions on Friday. What should we do with the remaining 70% position now?  With the breakout above the downtrend line, the cryptocurrency has invalidated the bearish descending triangle pattern, which is a bullish sign. A rally to $0.30000 is likely. Above $0.30000, the digital currency can rally to $032500 and $0.34000. Once these two levels are crossed, a move to $0.40000 is likely. However, considering the overhead resistances, we recommend booking profits on 50% of the existing long positions and holding the rest with a stop loss of $0.23500. We shall keep trailing this stop loss higher as the cryptocurrency moves up. On the downside, we expect a strong support at $0.25000 levels. A breakdown and close below this level will be negative for the cryptocurrency. Lackluster trading in Litecoin continues. The cryptocurrency is not showing any buying interest.  Over the weekend, Litecoin could not even cross the 20-day exponential moving average, which is a bearish sign. If the cryptocurrency breaks below $50, a fall to $44 is likely. As the digital currency has previously taken support at $44, we expect buyers to step in again this time. However, we shall wait for a confirmation before jumping in to buy at the lower end of the range. We are not recommending any trade on Litecoin until we get a breakout above $58.

The beauty of trading is that when prices are correcting, there’s news of doom all around. All the bears come out of hibernation, forecasting a crash, and the bulls hide in a corner. The exact opposite happens when price reaches lifetime highs. This creates fear in the minds of the traders who miss buying at the lows and selling at the highs. Therefore, we focus on the price action to forecast the next possible move. Now that Bitcoin is close to its highs, what should we do? Traders who went long at lower levels on our recommendations have been booking profits near resistances. We are left with about 30 - 35 percent of our original position, which we had planned to book at $5000. Should we book out close to the highs, or wait for higher levels?  Yesterday, the cryptocurrency reached a high of $4932.9, very close to our target levels. However, selling at the highs has pushed Bitcoin back below the $4800 levels. As the digital currency is trading above $4680, chances are that it will again attempt to breakout to new highs soon. If the bulls are successful in sustaining above $5000, the cryptocurrency is likely to gain momentum, and it will indicate the start of a new uptrend. Therefore, we recommend holding the existing position with a stop loss of $4500. We don’t want to keep a deeper stop loss because, usually, when bulls fail to breakout of a strong overhead resistance, bears sell aggressively, sending prices lower. So, if the bulls fail to breakout and sustain above $5000, we can expect the bears to push the cryptocurrency down to at least $4184.6 levels, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $2974 to $4932.9. Traders who went long at $317 with a stop loss of $278 on our recommendation had to face a loss. In hindsight, it looks like we purchased at the highs of the range and sold off at the lows of the range.  However, we had intended to buy on a breakout of the range. As the range had been building for a few days, we believed that it would have enough force to carry it higher. Therefore, we didn’t recommend waiting for a close above the range to initiate long positions. Similarly, on the downside, we’d expected that once the cryptocurrency broke out, it wouldn’t return to the lows of the range. Nevertheless, Ethereum proved us wrong on both fronts. So, how can we trade Ethereum now? Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading close to the center of the range. We don’t want to enter a long trade unless Ethereum breaks out and closes above $317. We may miss out on a few points, but at least we won’t be caught in these fake breakouts and breakdowns. We shall keep an initial stop loss of $278 only, because, we don’t expect prices to fall back below the range, once it breaks out and closes above it. We have been correct in avoiding Bitcoin Cash on the long side. On Oct. 9, the cryptocurrency broke below the critical support of $300, forming a low of $280.1. So, is this low level a good time to buy?  Bitcoin Cash is devoid of buyers. Though the digital currency has recovered above $300 levels, it continues to make lower lows and lower highs, which suggests that a bottom is still not in place. Until the digital currency remains below $385 and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), it will continue to face selling pressure on rallies. On the lower end, Bitcoin Cash can fall to $285 and thereafter to $200 levels. On the upside, any rally towards $385 levels is likely to face stiff resistance. We don’t find any buy setup on the cryptocurrency; therefore, we don’t have any recommendation on it. The sharp fall on Oct. 9 hit our stop loss at $0.23500 on the 35 percent of our remaining position. This is the reason we always recommend booking partial profits as the price moves higher, especially when the cryptocurrency is not in a strong uptrend. Presently, we don’t have any positions in Ripple.  It has recovered after falling below the downtrend line on Oct. 9. However, bulls will face stiff resistance at $0.28000 and $0.30000. On the downside, the cryptocurrency has support at $0.23000. Considering the levels, we don’t find a trade set up with a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we shall wait and watch until we get a good entry point. There is nothing much happening in Litecoin. The cryptocurrency is stuck inside the range, due to which traders seem to have abandoned it at the moment.  Litecoin has a history of forming ranges and then breaking out of them. We’re currently in a similar situation. Whenever the price breaks out of the upper end of the range at $58, chances are that it will again take off. Until then, the cryptocurrency is likely to trade between $44 and $58. We shall not take a trade inside this range.

Find out what’s going with other cryptocurrencies and what trading moves to consider.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The traders continue to pile on Bitcoin, while altcoins languish. Bitcoin’s market dominance has crossed 55 percent, which shows that it’s now becoming a crowded trade. At times, it’s a good strategy to take the contrarian bet against the crowd. So, is it a good time to book profits on our Bitcoin positions and buy a few altcoins, or does Bitcoin have legs to further extend the rally? Let’s see. Leading up to its first fork in August, Bitcoin prices were in a corrective phase till about 15 days prior to the D-day. This time, however, prices have been in a consistent uptrend since bottoming out on Sept. 15.  After Bitcoin Cash was created, Bitcoin broke out and closed at new highs on Aug. 5, which started a strong uptrend that carried the cryptocurrency roughly 71 percent higher in just under a month. Will the same scenario be repeated this time? Looks unlikely. Last time, there were a number of folks who had sold off prior to the fork and were sitting on the sidelines. When Bitcoin did not crash, as a few had expected, all this money jumped back in, boosting prices within a short span of time. However, this time, people seem to be buying prior to the fork, so that they can benefit from the new coins. This is looking like a crowded trade. Can this get more crowded? Certainly. However, as we are sitting on decent profits on about 35 percent of our original position, we recommend booking out completely at current levels. Can prices rise further from here and make us look like fools? They certainly can. However, it can equally fall back below $5000 once this buying frenzy ends. It’s always better to pocket good gains after a buying stampede and wait for the next opportunity. We may have to buy at higher levels, but, that’s how it is. It’s very difficult to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. Nevertheless, for traders who want to hold on to their long positions, the next target on the cryptocurrency is $6197. Bitcoin has support at the $5000 levels, which had been a strong resistance until now.  The cryptocurrency will not become negative until it breaks below $4800 levels. Ethereum continues to remain volatile, but is on the verge of breaking out of the range. In our last trade, we were caught on the wrong side, as the breakout was faded by the bears. So, how should we approach it now?  Even today, the cryptocurrency has formed a very large range with an intraday high of $352.52 and an intraday low of $274.67. Though prices have broken out of the range, which makes us bullish, the stop loss for the trade is very deep. After four previous false breakouts, we would rather wait for Ethereum to end the day above the range, signaling the start of a new uptrend. On a close above the range, our first target is $354, above which, a move to $400 is also possible. However, we are not recommending a trade on Ethereum until we get a closing above $317. Bitcoin Cash is not showing any interest either from bulls or bears. It continues to slide gradually, struggling to hold the $300 levels.  The cryptocurrency is attempting to find support at the $282 levels. However, the pullback from the support is not very convincing. If Bitcoin Cash breaks below the immediate support zone of $265 to $282, it is likely to retest the lows. On the other hand, any pullback is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). There are no bullish setups, therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it. As is the case with most altcoins, Ripple is also facing selling pressure. As a result, it has fallen back into the descending triangle.  The cryptocurrency is attempting to hold the 20-day EMA. It if bounces off this support, it is likely to rally towards the recent swing high of $0.28000, above which a move to $0.30000 is also possible. However, if the digital currency breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it has some support from the small uptrend line and the 50-day simple moving average. Aggressive traders can go long on Ripple if it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle, and the smaller downtrend line drawn from the recent highs of $0.28000. This level is likely to be around $0.26000. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $0.23000. We don’t want to hold the cryptocurrency if it again falls back into the triangle. The target objective on the upside is $0.30000. Litecoin is one of the few altcoins that showed strong buying support yesterday. Though we did not have a buy recommendation on Litecoin, we did mention that it will become positive once it breaks out of the range.  Yesterday, the cryptocurrency rose sharply, breaking out of the overhead resistance of $57.72. However, today, the digital currency is facing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $58 mark. If traders entered long positions at $58, please hold with a stop loss of $48. The first target objective is $71. Others who have not yet entered long positions can wait and enter above $61, which will signal a victory for the bulls. The stop loss, in this case, can be kept at $50 and the profit objective remains $71.

114,2017-10-14 11:50:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Delaware Judge Throws Out Case Against Blockchain-Based Payment Network Ripple,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Ripple claims victory over R3 in XRP lawsuit case. Regulations In an apparent victory for the Blockchain-based payment network Ripple, a Delaware judge ruled in their favor regarding the recent lawsuit over R3 consortium’s wish to force the company to make good on a contract to buy a huge volume of XRP. The news broke via Ripple’s Twitter account: Breaking news! https://t.co/tK0tHPjQ6Z R3, the ‘Blockchain-inspired’ startup servicing banks and financial institutions, maintains that Ripple Labs has violated a prior purchase agreement for XRP tokens between the two companies. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, started the Twitter feud, indicating that the judge in the Delaware lawsuit had ruled to ‘throw out’ the case. However, after further information came to light, the judge had issued a verbal ruling regarding Delaware’s jurisdiction over the matter. The lawsuit will proceed, however, in California and New York. The case, according to others, will continue in California and New York. R3 is suing Ripple for specific performance of an option agreement in which Ripple agreed to sell up to five bln XRPs for a price of $.0085. Ripple has countersued, claiming that R3 reneged on a number of contractual promises, and is simply acting in a spirit of opportunism, after the cryptocurrency soared more than 30 times over.

115,2017-10-16 19:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 16","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Latest price review and trading suggestions on most popular cryptocurrencies.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. While on one side, the traditional money managers and investment bankers continue to voice their opposition to Bitcoin, the State bank of Mauritius (SMB) has approved the use of Blockchain assets as collateral for loans. Russia, on the other hand, is moving ahead with its own ‘CryptoRuble’, according to local news sources. Will this cryptocurrency succeed? Only time will tell. However, early investors in cryptocurrencies continue to report staggering returns. One such person to report greater than 50,000% returns was Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange. While a similar increase from the current levels is unlikely, we can still ride the trends and earn triple-digit returns in a calendar year. We have no existing positions in Bitcoin. We recommended selling our remaining positions in the cryptocurrency on October 13. Our selling price was $5650, a tad below where Bitcoin is trading now. Right now the digital currency is trading near a significant resistance from the ascending channel line. It has been unable to breakout of this resistance on four previous occasions. This is not to say that it can’t breakout. It certainly can. However, this is a good place to book profits and wait for the next opportunity. If the price breaks out of the channel, it is likely to become very positive and rally to $6400 quickly. We shall try to enter this trade if we get a good entry and stop loss point. However, if the bulls are unable to break out of the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency will either be range bound between $5400 and $5800 or correct to the breakout levels of $5000. At the current levels, we don’t find a trade setup offering us a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we are currently not recommending any trade on the cryptocurrency. Ethereum remained volatile ahead of its fork. Now, that the event is behind us, we expect the volatility to reduce. We don’t have any existing position in Ethereum, as we were waiting for a breakout and close above the range. On October 13, though the cryptocurrency broke out of the range, it closed way higher for us to enter any position. Also, due to the huge intraday swings, we have stayed away from it. Currently, it is facing selling above the $350 mark. Though it has broken above this level in intraday trading, it has not been able to close above it. If we don’t see a close above $350 within the next two days, the bears are likely to sink the cryptocurrency back towards $316 levels. On the other hand, if the bulls manage a close above $350, Ethereum can rally to $390 levels. However, as the cryptocurrency lacks momentum at the current levels, we are not suggesting any trade on it. Bitcoin Cash has been trading in a very small range for the past few days. Though the fall has been arrested, it is yet to show any buying interest. The bulls are currently only trying to defend the $282 levels. If this level breaks, a fall towards the lows is likely. However, for the digital currency to become positive again, it has to first break out of the downtrend line and form a series of higher highs and higher lows. Until then, every pullback towards the downtrend line and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) is likely to face selling pressure. After a few days of low volatility, we expect volatility to increase over the next few days. However, it is difficult to forecast which way Bitcoin Cash will move.  Therefore, presently, we think it’s better not to trade it. We had recommended a long trade on Ripple in our previous analysis for the aggressive traders. Our profit objective was $0.3. What should we do now?  Ripple is close to our first target objective, where it is likely to face some resistance. Therefore, we suggest traders to book 30% profits on the existing positions at the current levels of $0.29 and hold the rest with a stop loss of $0.26. This way, we will pocket a small profit and our remaining position becomes risk-free. If the digital currency breaks out of $0.3 levels, it can rally to $0.325 and $0.34 levels. Therefore, we want to hold the remaining position. However, once Ripple moves higher, please trail the stops accordingly. We have long positions in Litecoin at $58 and $61. Our profit objective was $71 and yesterday, the cryptocurrency reached a high of $70.466. Though we would have booked at least 30% profits close to $70, we had not recommended it. The cryptocurrency is currently facing selling at the $70 levels. Today, it dipped back to $62 levels, where buying emerged. Currently, it is attempting to climb back again. However, traders who are long at $58 and $61 should increase their stop loss to breakeven. We don’t want to see a loss on our positions after being so close to the target. If the digital currency doesn’t breakout of $67, it will again fall to $58 levels. However, if Litecoin rallies back to $70, please sell 30% positions and hold the rest with the stops at breakeven. We shall raise the stop loss once Litecoin breaks out of $71.

116,2017-10-19 15:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Japanese Ripple Crypto Exchange Takes Hit as Founder Arrested for Scam,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   A manager at a Ripple exchange has swindled $12,470 Scam Alert Ripple cryptocurrency exchange in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, was raided by police as they closed in on the manager of the exchange who was looking to make off with ¥1.4 mln ($12,470) of one of their customer’s money. Yuki Takenaka, the 31-year-old founder and head of a company operating the Ripple exchange, collected his stolen funds even though his firm was in a state of collapse and unable to make refunds at that time. It is the first arrest in Japan made in connection with a bourse of the Ripple virtual currency, as Takenaka has admitted to most of the charges, according to the police. Having set up the exchange in May 2014, Takenaka quickly fell out of favour as users were unable to withdraw cash or contact him. In a strange business model, his company collected money from its users in exchange for IOUs, or written acknowledgements of debt, needed for Ripple online transactions. Users could exchange the notes with Ripple or convert them into cash. But it has also emerged that Takenaka allegedly swindled more than ¥10 mln out of a dozen users by false advertising that his company charges no commission. Additionally, there are investigations into the supposed issuing of fictitious IOUs which amount to approximately ¥120 mln. Ripple, as a cryptocurrency, is slightly different to others, as they are looking to become a legitimate digital currency for use within the banking sector; and they pride themselves on being centralised. The Ripple currency is usually used for international payments and cannot be used for merchandise purchases. Ripple is looking to break into the banking market with its tough regulations, and while this incident has nothing to do with Ripple as a currency, it shows yet again that the crypto market is still a wild west for many and there is very little protection for individuals.

117,2017-10-21 16:35:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 21","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Our latest prices review and trading suggestions.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Only a few months back, the market capitalization of the whole cryptocurrency universe crossed the $100 bln mark. Now Bitcoin alone has crossed the $100 bln mark. In doing so, it has increased its dominance to 58.5 percent, a level last seen in May this year. This shows that money is pouring into Bitcoin, whereas altcoins are getting hammered. At some point in the near future, once the leader tires out, other popular coins are likely to offer an excellent buying opportunity. Is Bitcoin nearing a top? Are altcoins ready to follow the leader? Let’s find out. Bitcoin is on fire. It has been consistently rising for the past two days. Can this rally continue? We don’t have any existing positions in Bitcoin, should we establish one at the current levels?  Bitcoin has reached a critical resistance level from the channel line. It has not been able to breakout of this channel since June of this year. A breakout of the ascending channel gives it a target of $8000, equal to the depth of the channel. However, this level is unlikely to be reached in the short-term. Therefore, we have to work with intermediate targets. The breakout from the range of $5391.4 to $5875 gives the cryptocurrency a minimum target objective of $6359. If this level is crossed, then the next possible level is $6845. Our higher targets will be invalidated if the virtual currency turns down from the current levels. As the risk to reward ratio is not attractive, we don’t recommend any fresh trade. However, investors carrying positions from lower levels should keep a stop loss of $5600. Once Bitcoin breaks out and sustains above the channel, the stops can be raised to about $5800 levels and then trailed higher. On the downside, $5875, the earlier resistance, will act as a strong support. Ethereum has been falling for the past six days. However, we expect it to hold the $275 to $286 zone, which has served as a strong support for the past month and a half.  We don’t recommend buying on the way down. We should wait for the next day or two to confirm that the support zone is holding, because a break of this support can sink Ethereum to $252 levels. If, however, the support holds, the digital currency is likely to trade in a range for a few days, then attempt to start a new uptrend. Presently, we don’t find any buy setup, therefore we don’t suggest any trade on Ethereum at the moment. While Bitcoin is roaring ahead to new highs, Bitcoin Cash has not found any buying support from the bulls. However, selling has subsided, which has resulted in small range days.  Presently, the digital currency is attempting to hold the $282 to $300 support zone. If Bitcoin Cash breaks this level, it will sink towards lows of $190. On the other hand, a breakout of $400 will signal a change in trend. Therefore, we recommend a long position only at $410, with a stop loss of $350. The target objective is $530.   We don’t hold any positions in Ripple. The digital currency is currently attempting to hold the $0.20 levels. However, buying interest has declined following the sharp reversal from $0.3 levels.  If Ripple breaks below $0.2, it’s likely to fall towards $0.15 levels, where we recommend to initiate long positions because it has not broken down of $0.145 on a closing basis since June this year. However, this trade should be taken on the way up, after Ripple confirms a bottom. Please don’t try to catch a falling knife and enter when the cryptocurrency is falling. The stop loss can be kept $0.126. On the other hand, if the virtual currency holds the $0.2 levels, it will again attempt to rally towards $0.3. But, we don’t find a reliable set up to trade this. Hence we don’t recommend a long position until Ripple falls to $0.15 levels and holds it. On Oct. 18, though Litecoin fell to $53 levels, it quickly climbed back higher and closed above $57.7. It has since then managed to stay above this support level. However, presently the cryptocurrency is threatening to fall into the range once again.  If Litecoin breaks below $57 and is unable to climb back quickly, it will invalidate the current bullish setup. However, if the cryptocurrency finds support at the current levels and turns up, a long position can be initiated at $63. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $55 and the profit objective is $71.

118,2017-10-23 21:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 23","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Latest trading review on the most popular cryptocurrencies.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Research shows that big institutional money is currently staying out of Bitcoin. Should this worry us or keep us from trading cryptocurrencies? We don’t think so. If one were to look back in time and check, very few investors saw the potential in Amazon and invested in it. Most kept calling it a bubble. Major disruptions are not easy to understand and accept. Historical comparisons and metrics fail while judging these new concepts. Therefore, most traditional investors and money managers lose out on a great opportunity. Currently, most big names in the investment industry are in denial about the rise and popularity of cryptocurrencies. They are just praying for a crash to say, ‘See, I told you so’. The main complaint is that cryptocurrencies are very volatile. Well, with proper planning, we can certainly keep our risk under control, as we do here. Let’s see, if we can find an opportunity to make money this week. After days of rally, gravity is finally catching up with Bitcoin. So, is this dip a buying opportunity or can it fall further?   We were correct in avoiding a long position in Bitcoin around the $6000 mark. Though intraday the digital currency broke out of the ascending channel, it could not close above it. Currently, the cryptocurrency is finding support just above $5500 levels. If the fall continues, Bitcoin can correct to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), which presently lies at $5359. The trendline support is also close to this level. Therefore, we expect the digital currency to bounce from this support zone of $5350 to $5500. On the upside, the resistance line of the ascending channel will act as a major hurdle. A breakout of this will clear the path for a bigger rally. However, the RSI is forming a negative divergence. The previous two negative divergences were followed by a sharp drop in prices. Additionally, we don’t find a reliable buy set up with a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we don’t recommend any trade on Bitcoin.   We were expecting Ethereum to hold its support zone of $275 to $286, but it looks like the cryptocurrency has other plans.  When zoomed out, we find that Ethereum has formed a large equilateral triangle pattern. We can draw the trendline support in two ways (both drawn on the chart). The first level of support is at $275, where we find both the trendline support and the horizontal support. We still believe that the cryptocurrency will attempt to hold this level. However, if this level breaks, the next lower support is in the zone of $252 to $240. We believe that buying should emerge at these critical levels. We shall wait for clear signs of a bottom formation before recommending any trade.   Bitcoin Cash attempted a rally yesterday, however, it could not breakout of the 20-day EMA. After the failed attempt, the cryptocurrency is again down today. While the bullishness of Bitcoin did not rub off on Bitcoin Cash, the bearishness certainly seems to be having its effect. The cryptocurrency is falling towards the lows of the range. Though the digital currency has not broken below this low since Aug. 11, the pattern is looking weak. Chances are that Bitcoin Cash will fall below $282. If the lower levels sustain for a day or two, then the fall will extend to $200 levels. Either way, we don’t see any buy set up until the cryptocurrency breaks out of $400. Therefore, we do not suggest any trade on it at the current levels.   Once Ripple broke below $0.2 levels, the fall gained momentum. The cryptocurrency seems to be in a hurry to sink to the $0.15 levels. Now, the cryptocurrency is likely to fall to $0.166, where we expect some buying to emerge. However, the slide is likely to continue, and Ripple is likely to fall to $0.15 levels. While in our previous analysis we had recommended a buy at the $0.145 levels, we now believe that it is better to wait for a day or two and then take a position. Therefore, we are withdrawing our buy call on Ripple. We prefer to wait and watch the price action at the support levels before buying it. We shall not buy until the cryptocurrency stops falling and indicates that it is ready to move higher. Litecoin did not trigger our buy levels, recommended in the previous analysis on Oct. 21. As a result, we don’t have any positions on it. The digital currency could not hold on to the $57.7 support level. It is back into the range of $44 to $57.7. It has support at $50, below which it will fall to the lower end of the range at $44. Though the cryptocurrency had taken support at $44 earlier, we shall not buy right away. We shall wait for a day or two and buy Litecoin when it confirms a bottom. The first signs of bullishness will be when the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line and rallies above $58 levels. Until then, all pullbacks are likely to be sold into.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. In August 2017 Bitcoin split in two, which resulted in the appearance of Bitcoin Cash, and yesterday the network experienced the second fork, Bitcoin Gold. Whether this is an advantage or disadvantage for Bitcoin is up for debate. Both sides have their own explanations. However, as traders, we look for historical precedence and attempt to trade using it. After the first fork, Bitcoin prices took off, rallying from a low of $2,621.75 on Aug. 2 to an intraday high of $4,975 on Sep. 2. That is a blistering 89.75 percent rally in a month. If history were to repeat itself, Bitcoin should rally to $10,443 by Nov. 24. That figure looks a little doubtful because most traders expect Bitcoin to fall now that the fork has been completed. They expect money to shift to the altcoins. We did see a spark of it in the last two days. However, that rally fizzled out. Can the rumor of Amazon accepting Bitcoin become a reality and give another boost to the cryptocurrency? We have to wait and watch for it. However, what do the charts forecast? Is it time to shift from Bitcoin to altcoins or will Bitcoin again attempt to resume its rally? Let’s find out. We have not initiated any positions on Bitcoin for the past few days. Is this a good time to get back into the game?   In our previous analysis, we had forecast Bitcoin to find support between the $5,350 to $5.500 zone. Today, the digital currency fell to $5,356.95 levels, where buying emerged. As there are two critical supports – from the trendline and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) – this can be a good entry point. However, we want to buy on the way up and not on the way down. Therefore, please initiate long positions at $5,650. We don’t expect a huge rally from the current levels. We expect a retest of the recent highs. Traders should book partial profits at $6,000 and raise the stops on the remaining positions to break even, if the cryptocurrency rallies according to our expectation. On the other hand, if Bitcoin turns around and breaks below $5,350 it can extend its fall to $5,000 levels. Therefore, please keep a stop loss of $5,300. The negative divergence on the RSI is a cause of worry. Therefore, we shall keep the allocation size 50 percent below normal. This is a very risky trade. Ethereum must have given some heartburn to our readers. It rallied from $275 to close to $320, and we could not catch it.  These volatile trades will be difficult to catch. At times, the support levels may break and at other times they may hold. The cryptocurrency had been falling for the past many days; therefore, we did not expect it to pullback so sharply. Nevertheless, after the quick rally, Ethereum has given up most of its gains and is back below $300 levels. Currently, the digital currency is likely to face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. It becomes bullish only on a breakout and closes above $315. Until then, we don’t see a reliable set up on it. On the downside, the trendline is a formidable support, which is likely to hold. However, as the price is quoting below both the moving averages, we don’t consider it as a good level to initiate long positions. That’s why we don’t recommend any trade on Ethereum at the moment. Bitcoin Cash is attracting some buyers at the current levels. There have been two attempts in the past three days to push the cryptocurrency higher. However, the 20-day EMA has been acting like a big hurdle on every pullback. If the price manages to break out of the 20-day EMA, it is likely to rally to the 50-day SMA, which is at $414, just above the upper end of the range. However, the logical stop loss for this trade is below the lower end of the range at $280. This doesn’t give us a 1:1 risk to reward ratio. Therefore, it doesn’t seem to be a good idea to trade. On the other hand, if the digital currency breaks down of the lower end of the range it can sink to $190. After a continuous fall from the $0.3 levels, Ripple is attempting to hold the $0.18 levels. An attempt to pullback faced resistance from both the moving averages. As a result, the cryptocurrency is again back at the $0.2 mark. If Ripple breaks down below yesterday’s low of $0.18211, it will resume its downtrend. The next stop is likely to be $0.165, followed by a retest of $0.15. On the other hand, any pullback attempt will face selling at the moving averages and the downtrend line. The digital currency will become positive only after it breaks out of $0.238 levels. Currently, there is no bullish setup. Therefore, we suggest no trade on Ripple. Yesterday, Litecoin attempted to break out of the overhead resistance of $58; however, the bears pushed it back into the range. The digital currency is again back into the range of $44 to $57.7. The cryptocurrency will become bullish only on a breakout and close above the upper end of the range. We recommend a buy on Litecoin on a close above $57.7. Our target objective is $71. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $51. On the contrary, if the bears continue to pound the digital currency, it can fall to the lower end of the range at $44. Therefore, we recommend a buy only after the bulls are able to push Litecoin out of this range.

Price Analysis The number of hedge funds which exclusively trade digital currencies has grown to 120, with about $2.3 bln in total assets under management, according to the financial research firm Autonomous Next. While it sounds like a large number, it pales in comparison to the $3.15 tln managed by the hedge fund industry in the third quarter. Cryptocurrencies have attracted only a small number of institutional investors because most still remain skeptical. The latest criticism comes from legendary investor Warren Buffet, who has said that Bitcoin is in bubble territory. Well, a correction after such a stupendous rally is certainly possible. Therefore, we always recommend a stop loss to our readers. Even if the digital currencies correct sharply, our losses will be limited and our capital will be preserved. We can again reinvest at lower levels. We had recommended long positions in Bitcoin in our previous analysis, with our target objective being $6000. On Oct. 27, the digital currency hit a high of $5986, where hopefully traders would have booked partial profits as suggested. Where is Bitcoin headed next?    Bitcoin is currently correcting towards the trendline support at $5600. Just below this support is the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $5513. We expect buying to emerge at these levels, however, we are not certain that this level will hold this time. Our stops at $5650 have been hit. We would like to sit back and wait, because if the support zone of $5513 to $5600 breaks, the digital currency will slide to $4975 levels. On the other hand, if the support zone holds then Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound between $5600 to $6000. However, the next buy on the virtual currency will only be triggered if it breaks out to new highs and crosses the resistance line of the ascending channel. Presently, we don’t find any buy setups, therefore, we don’t not recommend any fresh trade on Bitcoin. We don’t have any existing positions or recommendations on Ethereum. The bulls and the bears are taking a break after the hugely volatile day on Oct. 22.  Ethereum has a slew of resistances from $300 to $315 levels. Therefore we recommend a long position only on a breakout, and close above $315 with a close stop loss. The first target is $353. On the downside, it has support from the trendline at $280, below which it is likely to fall to $272 and thereafter to $252 levels. At current levels we don’t find any buy setups on Ethereum, hence we do not suggest to trade on it. We had observed some buying in Bitcoin Cash but we did not recommend any trade because the risk to reward ratio was not favorable. Do we see a trade on it now?  The cryptocurrency is currently returning from the upper end of the range at $400. The 50-day simple moving average is also at $398. Therefore, we expect a stiff resistance at $400 levels. However, if the digital currency breaks out of this overhead resistance, it has a pattern target of $518. Hence, we can buy on a breakout and close above $400. We shall limit our risk by keeping a stop loss of $350. We don’t want to hang on to the trade if it falls back into the range. However, if Bitcoin Cash fails to breakout and close above $400, it is likely to remain range bound for a few more days. Both the buyers and the sellers seem to have deserted the digital currency in the past three days, as a result of which, the volatility has shrunk. However, this period of low volatility is unlikely to sustain for a long time. We should soon see an expansion in volatility.  If Ripple breaks out of the moving averages, it should attempt a pullback to at least $0.23955 levels, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $0.29699 to $0.18211. If the virtual currency breaks out of this level, then a rally to $0.25311 and $0.27241 is also possible. Therefore, we recommend a long position at $0.22 with a stop loss of $0.19650. As this is a risky trade, we suggest using only about 30 percent of the usual allocation. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout on the upside, it can drift down to $1.8211 levels. Litecoin has not been able to breakout of the range of $44 to $57.7. Therefore, our buy levels were not triggered.    The 50-day SMA is situated at $55.59, while the 20-day EMA is at $56.57. Just above the moving averages is the upper end of the range at $57.729. If the digital currency breaks out of all these resistances, chances are that it will start a new uptrend. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation provided in our previous analysis. Please buy on a breakout and close above $57.7. The stop loss is $51, whereas the target objective is $71. If Litecoin fails to breakout of the overhead resistance, it will fall back towards the $52 levels.

121,2017-10-31 02:40:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 30","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Bitcoin trading might be back to China; Warren Buffett fearing the bubble, and more. How has the market responded?   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. A bullish rumor doing the rounds was that the Chinese ban on bitcoin trading is likely to be lifted. That news boosted Bitcoin’s price higher yesterday. However, a parting message by Huobi poured cold water on the expectations. As a result, Bitcoin prices are correcting from their highs. While Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, and a few others are warning of a bubble in Bitcoin, the legendary investor Bill Miller is smiling away to the bank. His fund is up 70% this year. Miller had invested about 30% of his fund’s assets in Bitcoin in early-2016. Elsewhere, a few central banks are trying to stifle the use of Bitcoin by banning it. Nevertheless, the beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they are not controlled by anyone. The market shall decide the value. Though the ban might make it difficult to use Bitcoin in the marketplace, it is unlikely to affect trading activity. Bitcoin has rebounded sharply from the trendline support and is attempting to breakout of the ascending channel. On Sunday, the cryptocurrency broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel, but could not sustain it. Though the ascending channel has been a stiff resistance and the RSI is also showing a negative divergence, we believe that if the digital currency again breaks out of the channel, it is likely to gain momentum and rally towards its target objective of $6845. Therefore, we recommend a buy at $6400 with a close stop loss of $6000. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please use only 30% of the usual allocation. If the cryptocurrency fails to breakout and sustain above the resistance line of the ascending channel, it can again fall to the trendline support. It will become negative, only if it breaks down of the trendline support and the 20-day exponential moving average, which is at $5623. Ethereum continues to trade in a range. It has still not been able to breakout of the overhead resistance at $315.  If the cryptocurrency breaks out of the resistance at $315, chances are that it will start a new uptrend. This time, we expect ethereum to breakout of $353 and head higher towards $366 levels. Therefore, we recommend a buy on Ethereum at $319 with a stop loss of $289. Partial profits can be booked at $350 levels and the stop loss on the remaining position can be trailed higher. On the other hand, if the digital currency fails to break out of the range, a fall to the trendline is likely. Ethereum will become negative if it breaks down and sustains below the trendline. Therefore, we recommend a buy, only on a breakout. Traders who initiated long positions on our recommendation would have earned a quick 22% return within a day. They would have entered at $422 and exit at the target objective of $518 on October 29. Bitcoin Cash broke out of the range on October 28 and has been sustaining above it since then. This is a bullish sign. Next, the cryptocurrency is likely to rally to $549 levels, where it can face some resistance, but if the bulls’ breakout of this overhead resistance, a move to $700 is possible. We, however, don’t find any reliable buy set up at the current levels, which offers us a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we don’t recommend any long position at the current levels. We shall wait for a small consolidation to re-establish the positions. Ripple has still not triggered our buy levels. It continues to trade in a tight range. The longer it trades in this range, the farther it will run when it starts a new uptrend or downtrend. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation on Ripple at $0.22, on a breakout above the moving averages. The stop loss should be kept at $0.19659. The breakout is likely to carry the digital currency to $0.23955 and $0.25311 levels, which are 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $0.29699 to $0.18211. Traders should raise their stops to breakeven once the cryptocurrency rallies to $0.23955. We suggest booking partial profits at $0.25311. The stop loss on the remaining position should be trailed higher. If the breakout fails to sustain, ripple is likely to remain range bound for a few more days. It will become negative only on a breakdown below $0.18211. Litecoin has still not closed above the range of $44 to $57.7. Therefore, our buy levels from the previous analysis have still not triggered.   Litecoin continues to consolidate near the upper end of the range, therefore, we are modifying our previous buy recommendation. We, now, recommend buying Litecoin at $59 with a stop loss of $53. Our profit objective remains $71, where we recommend booking 50% profits. The remaining position can be held with a trailing stop loss because if the digital currency breaks out of $71, it can rally to $82 levels. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout and sustain above the range, it can again fall towards the $51 levels.

122,2017-11-13 21:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, November 13","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Trader’s view on most popular cryptocurrencies price movement.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Bitcoin’s expected SegWit2x hard fork did not materialize, which led to large-scale dumping of the cryptocurrency. This awakened the sleeping giant, Bitcoin Cash, which surprised everyone with its huge vertical rally. Instead of Ethereum flippening Bitcoin for the leader’s position, Bitcoin Cash flipped Ethereum to take the second spot. However, gravity caught up with Bitcoin Cash helping Ethereum regain its number two spot. Meanwhile, experts continue to provide bullish forecasts for Bitcoin, both for the short-term and the long-term. Let’s see, what do the charts forecast. After the rally from $650 to $2,969.99, the cryptocurrency had taken support at the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. In the second leg of the rally, which carried Bitcoin from $1,752 to $4,975, the correction extended to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. The current fall has retraced about 50 percent of the rally from $2,974 to $7,875. Both the previous bottoms had formed with a large range bullish bar at the lows. Today’s strong bullish move is very similar to the price action during the previous two bottom formations. However, the current rally is facing resistance at the trendline, which previously had acted as a support. The 20-day EMA also lies at the same levels. Therefore, we need to watch the $6,500 levels carefully. If Bitcoin is able to scale above the trendline, chances of a retest of the highs increase. On the other hand, if the digital currency turns down from the trendline, a retest of yesterday’s lows is likely. We don’t have a clear buy signal with a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, no trades are recommended at the moment. A few months back, Ethereum was the darling of the traders. However, of late, it has not generated any notable buying interest. Is the scenario about to change?  Ethereum has been trading within the range of $280 to $315. The bulls successfully broke out and closed above the overhead resistance on two occasions, but they could not sustain the rally. However, the third breakout of the range is likely to be successful. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the cryptocurrency at a close above $315. Stop loss should be kept at $280. The first target objective is $353; however, it is expected to be broken. Hence, once prices rally to $353, please raise the stops to breakeven. Book 50 percent profits at the $367 mark and trail the stops higher. We had correctly spotted the rally in Bitcoin Cash in the initial stages. The moves the price experienced over the last couple of days, usually, end up hurting a lot of buyers who arrive late to the party, on fears of having missed out on the rally. Therefore, many times, we prefer to miss a rally if we don’t have a good risk to reward ratio, rather than jump in and repent later.  Currently, Bitcoin Cash is correcting the mind-boggling rally, which took it from under $300 levels to $2,799, an 833 percent rally within a matter of 21 days. The usual Fibonacci retracement levels could not offer any support during the correction. We expect the digital currency to find support at the $972 levels, which was the previous high, created on Aug. 19 of this year. If the support holds, we may see a resumption of the uptrend. However, there will be a huge overhang of sellers, stuck at higher positions. Therefore, we don’t expect a repeat vertical rally. If, however, the support of $972 breaks, the cryptocurrency is likely to fall to $611 levels. We don’t find any buy setups on Bitcoin Cash; hence, we are not recommending any trade on it. Ripple has been a laggard. The bulls have not shown any buying interest, even when the other altcoins were on fire. Ripple has been trading within the narrow range of $0.18 on the lower end and $0.22 on the upper end. Attempts to breakout and breakdown of this range have been unsuccessful. Additionally, the previous attempt to rally faced significant resistance at the downtrend line. Therefore, unless the cryptocurrency breaks out of $0.22, it is unlikely to find buying support. On the downside, a breakdown and close below $0.18 will sink Ripple to $0.166 levels. It might be a good idea to buy Ripple on a breakout and close above $0.22. The stop loss for the trade should be kept at $0.17. On the upside, we expect a rally to $0.3 levels.   Though we haven’t seen any fireworks in Litecoin, it has at least broken out of the range of  $44 to $57.7. Should we buy it now?   Litecoin’s attempts to breakout of the range have faced selling pressure at higher levels. However, the bulls have maintained their buying pressure, increasing the chances of a rally. The pattern target of the breakout of the range is $71. We suggest buying Litecoin at the current levels of $60.4, with a stop loss of $52. We don’t want to hang on to the stock if it falls back into the range once again. Please book 50 percent profits at $71 and raise the stops on the remaining position to break even because we expect a rally to $80 levels.

Per the announcement, the platform is already being used. The specific application is for Business to Business (B2B) payments between US corporate customers and UK based customers banking with Santander UK. The service will provide real-time trackable payments between customers. This connection is just one in a long journey for Amex, per the company’s press release. According to AMEX CIO Marc Gordon: “American Express has a long history of integrating new technologies. This collaboration with Ripple and Santander represents the next step forward on our Blockchain journey, evolving the way we move money around the world.” The connection for Ripple is a substantial win, especially in light of recent problems with legal issues after a dispute over a huge number of XRP coins with startup R3.

Low volatility for Bitcoin Cash? See what else.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Blockchain technology is likely to change a lot of things in our lives within the next few years. And that’s why the torchbearer of the technology, Bitcoin, continues to catch the fancy of the investors worldwide. While the debate is open about, which is the best cryptocurrency for the future, currently, looking at the demand, Bitcoin is clearly in the front. Bitcoin’s dominance is such that, the difference in market capitalization between the number one and the number two cryptocurrencies has widened to more than $100 bln. Will this gap swell further or is it time for Bitcoin to take a breather? Let’s find out. On Nov. 12, Bitcoin hit a low of $5,450.86, but within a span of eight days, the cryptocurrency has risen more than 50 percent. This shows the kind of demand at lower levels.    As Bitcoin continues to make new lifetime highs, it is difficult to become bearish on it. However, it is currently trading inside an ascending channel. The cryptocurrency is close to the resistance line of the channel. I anticipate some profit booking around the $8,500 mark. However, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of this ascending channel, it can rally to $9,969 and thereafter to $11,068 levels. In order to reach these two levels, Bitcoin will have to rally 21 percent and 35 percent from the current levels. If the breakout fails, the virtual currency is likely to fall to $8,000 and thereafter to $7,420 levels. A break below $8,000 is likely to lead to a negative divergence. Considering the overhead resistance from the channel line and the negative development on the RSI, I don’t consider any trade at the current levels to be a good idea.   On Nov. 13, I proposed a long position on Ethereum once it broke out and sustained above the $315 levels. The trade triggered on Nov. 14.  I had suggested booking 50 percent profits at $367. The level was touched on Nov. 19. I am still left with 50 percent of the positions, which should be held with stops at breakeven because Ethereum can rally to $378. At this level, the digital currency will face resistance from the downtrend line of a symmetrical triangle. However, if it manages to breakout and close above this level, the price is likely to gain momentum. The pattern target of the breakout from a symmetrical triangle is $645. I want to enjoy this ride if it materializes. Hence, I’ll keep the stop loss on the remaining 50 percent position at breakeven. The boom and bust in Bitcoin Cash has caught the fancy of many traders. However, after a period of high volatility, I expect a period of low volatility.  Both the bulls and the bears are likely to fight it out in the ring, as they decide whether to carry it higher or push it lower. Meanwhile, the digital currency is likely to remain range-bound between $850 and $1,550. This is a large range, which can be traded. I’ll wait for a fall to the $850 to enter my long positions. Contrarily, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $1,550, it is likely to rally to $2,249 levels. Therefore, I recommend a trade closer to the lower end of the range at $850 or on a breakout above $1,549 levels. On Nov. 13, I had recommended to go long on Ripple once it breaks out and closes above the tight range of $0.18 to $0.22.  On Nov. 16, price broke out above the downtrend line, the moving averages and the horizontal resistance at $.022. The closing price was $0.22713, which triggered our entry. While my initial stop loss suggestion was $0.17, I would like to reduce the risk. Therefore, I wouldn’t raise the stops to $0.20 levels. My profit objective is $0.30 levels. However, there is a possibility that Ripple will breakout of $0.3 and rally towards the lifetime highs. Hence, I think booking 50 percent profits at $0.3 and holding the rest with stops at breakeven sounds.    I had suggested long positions at $60.4 on Nov. 13, as Litecoin had broken out of its range of $44 to $57.   The pattern target was $71, a level that was reached on Nov. 16. I had recommended selling only 50 percent positions at the target objective because I expect the rally to extend to $82 levels. I’ll change my bullish view, if the cryptocurrency again falls back into the range. Think about keeping the SL on the positions at breakeven. Once Litecoin breaks out above $75,  I’ll raise the stops to $64.

125,2017-11-22 21:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, November 22: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Here’s a trading review on top cryptocurrencies.   * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Though the stock markets around the world are in a bull run, their returns pale in comparison to the cryptocurrencies. Hence, wealth managers will soon have to start investing a portion of their assets in digital currencies. In that regard, a French asset management company TOBAM has announced the creation of a Bitcoin mutual fund, which will help its clients gain exposure to Bitcoins. Even JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon has been critical of Bitcoin is likely to offer its clients access to Bitcoin futures. While many investors like Mike Novogratz and Ronnie Moas continue to be bullish on Bitcoin, commodity guru Jim Rogers has warned of a bubble. Let’s study the charts to find out if we can spot a trade. Yesterday, though the bears attempted to break the momentum in Bitcoin, their endeavor was met with strong buying by the bulls at lower levels.    The digital currency has closed above the $8,000 levels for the past two days. This shows that the momentum is intact and buyers are willing to step in on every dip. However, the bullish momentum will halt if the bears manage to push Bitcoin below $7,700 levels. On the other hand, a breakout above the ascending channel will be bullish for the cryptocurrency. I anticipate a move to $9,969 if Bitcoin sustains above $8,500 levels. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash towards the target. Whole numbers, usually, act as a resistance; hence, I expect a hurdle at $9,000. For any fresh trades, the risk to reward ratio is not favorable, as the stop loss is deep. Therefore, I am not suggesting any long positions at the current levels. For the past three days, Ethereum has been facing resistance at the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle.    If the digital currency can breakout and close above this resistance line, it will become positive. Its immediate targets are $395 and $421. However, I anticipate a breakout of both these overhead resistances. Hence, I suggest holding on to the 50 percent open positions initiated back at $315 levels. Our present stop loss is way back at $315. Let’s protect some of the paper profits. You might want to raise the stop loss on the existing position to $330, which is just below the 20-day EMA. After trading in a tight range for the past three days, Bitcoin Cash is trying to resume its uptrend. It has broken out of the small downtrend line, which is a bullish development. Traders can initiate long positions at $1,360 levels and keep a stop loss of $1,100. I expect the traders who missed out on the previous rally to buy, once the uptrend resumes. There is a small resistance at $1,400 and another one at $1,549. However, I expect Bitcoin Cash to breakout of these resistances and rally towards $1,825 and $2,054.9, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $2,799 to $851.12. Don’t initiate the long positions at lower levels because a failure to sustain above the downtrend line will indicate selling at higher levels. Therefore, please wait and buy at the suggested levels. This is a risky trade, hence, please keep the allocation size only about 50 percent of the usual. The trade on Ripple is live from Nov. 16 at a buy price of $0.22713. I had expected the digital currency to pick up momentum once it crossed above the downtrend line and both the moving averages. However, it is struggling to move above $0.245 levels. A correction from the current levels can push the cryptocurrency back to $0.22, which is a strong support. On the other hand, if it can rally above $0.245 levels within a day or two, it is likely to rise towards $0.30, which is a good place to lock in at least 50 percent profits. On the previous two instances, the virtual currency faced considerable selling at $0.3 levels. Generally, it is seen that the breakout happens on the third attempt. Hence, I believe in keeping 50 percent long positions with a trailing stop loss. A breakout above $0.3 can propel Ripple towards the lifetime highs.    Our traders are carrying long positions from $60.4 levels. I had suggested booking 50 percent profits at $71 and holding the remaining positions with stops at breakeven. However, for the past five days, the digital currency is finding it difficult to breakout of $72.   It is facing selling at the upper end of a larger range. If Litecoin doesn’t breakout of this overhead resistance soon, it will start a correction. Therefore, stops on the remaining positions can be raised to $64. Let’s at least protect partial paper profits. However, if the digital currency breaks out and closes above $72, a move to $82 or even to the lifetime highs is possible.

126,2017-11-25 20:18:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, November 25: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Bitcoin uptrend remains, Dash is number 5 right now, and all the other price highlights of the week.   With the launch of Bitcoin derivatives contract by the CBOE, we can expect more high-profile investors to enter the fray. However, as some investors believe that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble, we might see large positions being built on both sides of the trade. Hence, volatility is likely to spike for a few days once derivatives trading starts. Traders should, therefore, reduce their position size when the volatility increases. In the meanwhile, let’s see what do the charts forecast. While the bears had their opportunity to put brakes on the rally in Bitcoin, they could not capitalize on it. As a result, the uptrend remains intact and strong.     After consolidating for the past five days, Bitcoin has resumed its uptrend. The bears have one last chance to stall the rally at the resistance line of the channel; however, the chart pattern points to a likely breakout. Though the negative divergence on the RSI is still intact, a breakout of the channel will invalidate the pattern, because the RSI will trend higher. What are the targets that we can work with? A few bears are likely to attempt to fade the breakout of the channel around the $8,750 mark. Above this, the next target is $9,000 and $9,969.13. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the channel resistance line and breaks below $7,400 levels. Until then, the uptrend in Bitcoin remains intact. Until last time, we had been showing a symmetrical triangle on the charts. This week, we have drawn an ascending triangle pattern. This is just to show that the charts are dynamic in nature and formations keep developing in real time.    Our readers are sitting on huge gains, as they had entered long positions way lower at $315. Corresponding to my philosophy of taking profits at critical resistances, we have already booked profits on 50 percent of our original purchase. For the remaining position, should we book profits at the current levels or will Ethereum rally further? The pattern target from the breakout of the ascending triangle pattern is $652. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash to these levels. We should see a pullback towards the $420 levels in the next few days. Therefore, I would recommend booking another 50 percent profits at the current levels and hold the remaining positions with stops at $390. I will raise the stops on the existing positions again within the next few days.   After the correction, Bitcoin Cash has resumed its uptrend and our traders must be carrying long positions from $1,360 levels, as advised in the previous analysis.  Presently, the digital currency is in a pullback, having reached close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $2,800 to $854.3135. If Bitcoin Cash holds the critical support level of $1,507, it will indicate strength. The ensuing rally is likely to breakout of $1,827 and move up to $2,056 levels, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. On the other hand, if the support at $1,507 fails, the digital currency is likely to fall back into the range. As I don’t believe in carrying huge risk, I recommend raising the stops to breakeven. Ripple has been a huge disappointment. It has not gained momentum even after breaking out of critical resistance levels. I hold long positions in the digital currency initiated back on Nov. 16 at $0.22713. Should we hold or fold our positions?  The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, with the 20-day EMA moving above the 50-day SMA. This is a bullish sign. Additionally, the digital currency has not given up its gains. The uptrend is likely to gain momentum once Ripple sustains above $0.245 levels. Nevertheless, as always, I want to limit my risk. So, I suggest raising the SL from $0.17 to $0.2 levels. I do not want to stick with the trade if it falls back into the range and below the downtrend line once again. My target on the upside remains $0.3, where the traders can book 50 percent profits. The remaining position should be held with a trailing stop loss. Litecoin has been nudged into the sixth position by Dash. Will the digital currency rally from the current levels and regain back its position?  I’m holding long positions in Litecoin from the $60.4 levels. The digital currency has gained momentum after breaking out of the resistance at $72. However, we may see another two to three days of consolidation at the current levels, as this is the final resistance before the virtual currency can challenge the lifetime highs. I, therefore, recommend holding the positions with stop loss at $70. If Litecoin fails to breakout of $84 within two days, please book partial profits and raise the stop loss on the remaining position. Dash has found a place in our analysis based on its stupendous run, which has propelled its market capitalization to just under $4.8 bln, making it the fifth largest coin by market capitalization.  Any cryptocurrency that makes a new high and sustains it denotes strength. Dash broke out to new highs on Nov. 12. Thereafter, it successfully completed a retest of the breakout levels at $415. Subsequent rally again made a new lifetime high. After a two-day correction, the digital currency has resumed its rally today. Its immediate target is $650, above which a move to $729.8 is also possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down to the $547 levels. As the risk to reward ratio is not attractive, I don’t recommend a fresh trade at the current levels at the moment. However, traders with existing positions can manage their trade using the above-mentioned support and target levels. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and BCH/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The huge volatility in Bitcoin on Nov. 29 caught a number of novice investors off-guard. This serves as a reminder to the traders that cryptocurrency trading should be taken seriously.  Additionally, this fall is likely to renew the debate among the believers and the non-believers. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winner, went as far as to demand a ban on Bitcoins. On the other hand, John McAfee, founder of McAfee Associates, has gone ahead and raised his target on Bitcoin to $1 mln by the end of 2020. Nonetheless, other than for the long-term investor, these sky-high targets are unlikely to be of much use. The trader is more concerned about the next 20-40 percent move. So, let’s try to jump into the charts and attempt to forecast the next direction. On Nov. 25, I had forecast a rally to $9,969, which proved to be a very conservative target. Bitcoin launched a vertical rally on Nov. 24, which peaked on Nov. 29 at $11,420.82 levels.  Vertical rallies are unsustainable and lead to a crash. Hence, it is good that the rally stalled. The present correction is likely to find support at the resistance line of the ascending channel. The trendline,  green color on the chart, also coincides with the channel support. So, I expect the zone of $8,750 to $9,100 to act as a formidable support. If, however, the bears succeed in breaking down this support, the 20-day EMA at $8,530 will act as the next support, below which a decline to $8,000 is possible. On the upside, yesterday’s high of $10,570.49 and the lifetime high of $11,420.82 will act as a stiff resistance. The volatility is likely to remain high for another four to five days when both the bulls and the bears will try to establish their supremacy. Thereafter, I expect the volatility to subside. The risk to reward ratio in the current volatile environment is not conducive for trading. Hence, I don’t recommend any trade today. It is better to stay safe and preserve capital than lose money in the whipsaws. Luckily, we had booked 50 percent profits on the existing positions in Ethereum at $483 levels. I had been expecting a retest of the breakout levels, but I had not envisaged a fall below $393. Therefore, I had recommended an SL of $390. Nevertheless, I was proven wrong and the SL was hit yesterday.      However, the ascending triangle pattern is still intact. If Ethereum manages to stay above the $393 levels, it is likely to resume its uptrend and attempt a rally towards its pattern target of $652. On the other hand, if the digital currency breaks down of $390, it is likely to slide to $350. Below this, a fall to $290 is also possible. I will prefer to stay on the sidelines and watch the setup develop over the next two days before any trade.      I had forecast a rally to $1,827 and $2,056 on Bitcoin Cash in my previous analysis. However, the digital currency could not breakout of the $1,758 levels.  After trading within a range of $1,507 to $1,758, the virtual currency broke down on Nov. 28. Currently, the bulls are attempting to take support at the 20-day EMA. If this level breaks down, a fall to $1,150 is likely. This is the final support, below which, the decline can extend to the 50-day SMA at $827. On the other hand, if the buyers step in at the 20-day EMA, a retest of $1,507 and $1,758 is likely. A very risky trade setup is a buy above $1,420 with a stop loss of $1120. The target objective on the upside is a retest of $1,758 levels. Only aggressive traders should take a shot at this trade and with only 50 percent of the normal position size. I had anticipated a rally to $0.3 on Ripple; however, it could not cross the $0.28 mark. From there, it plunged back to the critical support of $0.22.  I expect the $0.22 levels to hold, at least in the short-term. The rebound is likely to face a stiff resistance at $0.25 levels, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $0.281 to $0.2195. Just a few days back also, $0.25 had acted as a strong resistance. Once above this level, a rally to $0.28 and thereafter to $0.3 is likely. Contrarily, if the $0.22 level breaks down, it can sink Ripple to $0.18 levels. Aggressive traders can attempt to go long at $0.251 and keep a stop loss of $0.218. The target objective on the upside is $0.28 and $0.3. This is a risky trade; hence, the position size should be less than 50 percent of usual. In my previous analysis, I had suggested a probable retest of the lifetime highs, which proved to be correct.  However, only the nimble-footed trader would have benefitted from the rise, because the digital currency plunged to about $76 levels on the same day. The positive news is that the 20-day EMA has not broken down, which keeps the uptrend intact. The next rally will face resistance at the $93 levels and at the lifetime highs. On the other hand, a decline is likely to take support at the 20-day EMA. However, if this support breaks, a fall to $64, to the 50-day SMA is possible. I will wait for the volatility to subside before recommending any trade. I had forecast a price target of $650 for Dash in my previous analysis, which was easily surpassed. In fact, this is one of the rare cryptocurrencies that was left untouched in the overall cryptocurrency market Nov. 29.  Currently, Dash is at the resistance line of the ascending channel, which is likely to be a difficult level of cross. I expect a couple of days of consolidation before the bulls attempt to resume the uptrend. The breakout and close above the ascending channel gives it a pattern target of $960. On the other hand, any correction is likely to find support at the trendline of the ascending channel, around the $680 mark. However, at the current levels, I don’t find any setups on the charts that offer a good risk to reward trading opportunity. Therefore, I have no recommendations a trade on it so far. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and BCH/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

128,2017-12-07 04:30:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Dec 06: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Dash is in the treadline, Bitcoin Cash is losing it. See what else.   When the price rallies unabated and seems to be able to reach the moon, we can be certain that a short-term top is around the corner. Can I pinpoint the top? No! Can the market continue higher and make me look like a fool? Yes, it certainly can! However, cashing in profits, especially after such a vertical run is a good strategy. I believe, it is time for Bitcoin investors to start booking partial profits on their investment positions. They will get ample opportunities to re-establish long positions at lower levels when the correction starts. The introduction of Bitcoin futures trading in just a few days will bring forth a number of short sellers who are likely to bet against the incessant rally. For the first time, the Bitcoin bulls will be face to face with the bears, who will have the tools to short sell the cryptocurrency. It is difficult to predict whether the short sellers will force price downwards leading to a long liquidation or the bulls will force a short squeeze from the bears. Considering the uncertainty, it is wise to reduce the risk. Let’s see, when should one start selling the positions. Since the low of $5450.86, on November 12, only one strategy has worked for Bitcoin, i.e., buy and hold. Traders who purchased at the lows are sitting on about 150% profits in less than a month. However, I never anticipated such a stellar rally. I kept waiting for the dip or a consolidation that could provide an attractive entry opportunity, which never materialized. Going back two years, we find that whenever the RSI reaches close to 89 levels, it has led to a correction, though not immediately. The current rally has pushed the RSI to the same overbought levels, which warns us that a correction is approaching. Where can we expect Bitcoin to top out? Bitcoin is likely to face resistance between $13380.68 and $15252.86, which are critical  Fibonacci extension levels. The target of $15252.86 is about 12% higher from the current levels. I would be wary of holding on to the currency to squeeze out the last few dollars in the trade. I recommend booking partial profits at the current levels and trailing the stops on the remaining positions according to individual risk appetite. For the traders who are sitting on the sidelines, I suggest waiting, until we get a decent correction and a low-risk trading opportunity. In my previous analysis, I had forecast a pattern target of $652 for Ethereum. A few readers believed that the level would be reached in December of this year itself.  Not likely. The ascending triangle pattern has formed over a 7-month period. Therefore, it may take even two to three months for Ethereum to reach its target objective. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all breakouts reach their desired targets. Therefore, traders should always protect their positions with a trailing stop loss.    The rebound from the $388.55 was strong. However, the cryptocurrency could not break out of the $480 levels. Ethereum has broken below the 20-day EMA. It has a strong support between the $388 to $400 levels. I expect this level to hold. Nevertheless, I don’t see any buy setups at the current levels. I will be waiting for the digital currency to show strength in the next couple of days before suggesting any trade.       I had suggested a long position at $1420 in my previous analysis. The position got filled on December 01, but the pullback stalled at the $1622.99 levels on December 03.    With Bitcoin garnering all the attention, the altcoins haven’t been able to find any buying support from the bulls. As a result, Bitcoin Cash has broken down of the 20-day EMA, which is a bearish development. However, as it is still quoting above the critical support of $1180, I suggest holding on to the position. Nevertheless, I propose to raise the stop loss from $1120 to $1170, just below the intraday low of November 30, because, below this level, Bitcoin Cash will become negative and can fall to $854 levels. The cryptocurrency will gain strength once it climbs above the 20-day EMA.   I had advocated a long position at $0.251 for the aggressive traders. The position was triggered on December 01 itself. However, contrary to my expectation, Ripple did not rally to the $0.28 mark. The pullback could not cross the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $0.281 to $0.2195 levels. After remaining in a range for three days, the price broke down on December 05. Yesterday, it broke below our stop loss of $0.2195. Now, the virtual currency can extend its fall to $0.19 levels. Litecoin is another currency that is showing considerable strength. It clocked a new lifetime high of $106.334 on December 03. However, it finds it difficult to break out of the resistance line of the ascending channel. The RSI is also forming a negative divergence, which is a bearish development. If Litecoin doesn’t break out of the overhead resistance within a day or two, it is likely to fall to the 20-day EMA. On the other hand, if it breaks out of the overhead resistance at $105, it will continue its uptrend and rally to $125 levels. As I don’t find any buy setups at the current levels, I am not advising any trade on it. I had forecast that Dash would experience difficulties breaking out of the ascending channel in the previous analysis, and that is what happened. After consolidating near the highs for three days, the digital currency broke down on December 05. It has extended its fall and is threatening to break down the trendline support of the ascending channel. The next support is at the 20-day EMA, at $640 and if this level also breaks, the cryptocurrency can fall to $605.66 levels, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $266.99 to $815. I will be expecting the pullback to end before suggesting any trade. It is better to remain on the sidelines until then, I believe. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and BCH/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move is risky, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Bitcoin is on the cusp of mass adoption, with futures trading starting on the CBOE from 6 p.m. ET on Sunday and on the CME from December 18. After the buying frenzy of the past few days, the question in everybody's mind is whether the trading in futures will boost prices higher or will the short sellers use the opportunity to sink prices lower. This is an unprecedented event; hence, it is very difficult to forecast the final outcome. Nevertheless, the volatility is likely to remain high in the first few hours and days of futures trading, as both the bulls and the bears slug it out at the CBOE. While the intraday traders can use the opportunity to profit from the volatility, it will be a difficult time for the investors. Additionally, how will the trading in Bitcoin affect the altcoins? Will it be bullish or will bitcoin garner all the attention? We will get the answers next week. Until I get a clear picture, I will not recommend any trading positions at the moment. The momentum in Bitcoin pierced through the critical Fibonacci resistance levels. It hit a high of $17237.44, well above the levels where I had advocated booking profits in my previous analysis.     After three large range days, the digital currency is forming an inside day candlestick pattern. I believe that the first few hours of futures trading are likely to be very volatile. It is difficult to predict, which way will the prices move. We can only keep certain levels in mind and work with them once the volatility subsides. On the downside, support is at $12734.97 and $11344.15, which are 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally from $5450.86 to $17237.44. On the upside, if price breaks out to new highs, its next level of resistance is the Fibonacci extension level of $18281.68. These levels are only guidelines. Tomorrow, Bitcoin can easily breakout or breakdown of these, hence, please trade with caution. I recommend staying on the sidelines for the next couple of days, unless one is an experienced intraday trader. Ethereum has been consolidating between $390 and $480 since breaking out of the ascending triangle pattern.    For the second time, $390 acted as a strong support level on December 07. As the bears are unable to sink the digital currency below $390, the bulls will attempt a breakout above $480. If successful, Ethereum is likely to quickly rally towards its pattern target of $652. On the other hand, if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the support levels of $390, the bullish view and the higher pattern targets will be invalidated. Therefore, traders can keep their stop-loss marginally lower than $390. Yesterday, Bitcoin Cash dipped below our stop loss levels; so I shall consider the position as closed. However, the dip proved to be temporary, as prices again recovered quickly.  Bitcoin Cash has become range-bound between $1129.33 on the lower end and $1758.4 on the upper end. At the current levels, it is right in the middle of the range. I suggest buying on a breakout above $1760 levels or waiting for a dip towards $1129 for initiating any fresh positions. A breakout of the range has a pattern target of $2387, above which, a retest of the high is possible. On the other hand, if the digital currency breaks down to $1129, it has support at $1000 from the 50-day SMA. If this level breaks, a fall to $854 is also possible. The fall on December 06, broke below my stop loss of $0.218. However, Ripple found support at $0.20 levels and has bounced back sharply once again.  The virtual currency has formed a large ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout of $0.3.  On the downside, the trendline of the triangle is likely to act as a strong support. Ripple will become negative only on a fall below the trendline. Until then, a rally to $0.30 is on the cards. Due to the volatility inside the triangle, the best place to buy is near the trendline support or on a breakout above the overhead resistance. Litecoin fell towards the 20-day EMA, just as I expected. From there, strong buying propelled it to new highs.  The breakout of the channel had a pattern target of $154, and Litecoin reached a high of $157.36. As the price has reached its target objective, partial profits can be booked at the current levels. I anticipate a couple of days of consolidation after which the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend once again.  The next target on the upside can be extrapolated only after the consolidation. The virtual currency is likely to find support at $140.22 and $129.612, which are 23.6% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels of the current rally. Dash fell to the 20-day EMA yesterday, where buying emerged, pushing it back into the ascending channel.  I expect the digital currency to retest the highs at $815 once again. If the bulls manage to breakout of this overhead resistance, we might see a rally towards the resistance line of the ascending channel. Dash will become negative only on a fall below $640 levels.

132,2017-12-16 19:51:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash: Price Analysis, December 16","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Again Bitcoin is breaking records, Ethereum has dropped pretty low, but managed to recover. See what else.   Bitcoin futures trading volume in its first week was only a fraction of cash Bitcoin transactions. Futures volume has been abysmal at $60 mln per day, compared to the cash transactions of $8.5 bln each day.   However, come Sunday, the CME will start Bitcoin futures trading. Additionally, large brokerage houses are likely to follow suit and allow their clients to trade in Bitcoin futures. If this happens, we are likely to see the futures volume pick up. Will the participation of more traditional investors boost the market capitalization of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency universe? Max Keiser who hosts the Keiser Report on RT certainly thinks so. He believes that futures trading will help the cryptocurrency market capitalization reach  $1 tln and higher. Notwithstanding, these are predictions for the long-term. Let’s look at the charts to find out the likely movement of cryptocurrencies in the short-term. Bitcoin broke out to new lifetime highs yesterday after a three-day consolidation. This is a bullish development.  The breakout opens up a pattern target of $24,291.58 for Bitcoin. However, this target is unlikely to be achieved in a hurry. The cryptocurrency is likely to face some resistance at  $20,000. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears overpower the bulls and sink the digital currency below $15,200 levels. With the start of futures trading on CME, we can expect an increase in volatility. Therefore, traders should reduce their position size for the next few days until volatility subsides. Intraday traders, however, will get ample opportunity to place bets on both sides of the trade.   Ethereum fell to a low of $610.03 yesterday, close to our expectation of a fall to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level.  The long tail yesterday shows that bulls are eager to buy the dips. However, failure to break out to new lifetime highs shows that they are booking profits at higher levels. As a result, Ethereum is likely to remain range-bound until the price breaches $610.03 on the downside or $780 on the upside. However, if the bulls’ breakout to new highs and sustain it, the next target on the cryptocurrency is $995.99. These targets are only assumptions based on technical analysis. Many times these targets are not met and we change our view accordingly. Therefore, traders should always trail their stops higher to safeguard their profits and not be fixated only on the target. We are in the money on our trade in Bitcoin Cash. So, does the chart pattern suggest further upside or has the rally run its course?    The cryptocurrency broke out and closed above the range on Dec. 14. This should have ideally propelled Bitcoin Cash towards its target objective of $2,387. However, it could not cross $2,100 levels. Subsequently, bears attempted to push the cryptocurrency back into the range. However, the bulls have managed to close above $1,758 levels for the past three days, which is a positive sign. The next up move will start once the price breaks out of $1,950 levels. Hence, please hold the positions with the stop-loss at breakeven. The bullish view will be negated once the price sinks below $1,520 levels. In our previous analysis we had recommended traders to book partial profits because we expected a strong resistance at $0.86 levels. On Dec. 14, Ripple topped out at $0.88268 levels.  On Dec. 15 the cryptocurrency pulled back to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. Nonetheless, the lower levels continue to attract buying from the bulls. We expect the bulls to attempt to break out of the lifetime highs again. If successful, Ripple will make a dash towards $1 levels and higher. However, if bulls fail to breakout and sustain above the lifetime highs, we are likely to witness a few days of range-bound trading between $0.61 on the lower end and $0.88268 on the upper end.   We anticipated a fall towards the 20-day EMA and that is what happened. On Dec. 14 and 15 IOTA fell close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally.  The bulls purchased the fall to the critical support levels. However, the cryptocurrency continues to face resistance on every rise. The chart pattern will become bullish in the short-term only on a breakout and close above the downtrend line, above which a rally to the lifetime highs is likely. Nevertheless, if price fails to breakout of the downtrend line, it will lead to the formation of a descending triangle pattern, which is a bearish development. The cryptocurrency will become negative on a breakdown and close below the critical support level of $3.032. We had forecast a period of correction/consolidation in our previous analysis and that is what we got.  As expected, the bulls purchased the dips to $243.86 levels, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. However, we believe that the levels between $300 and $342.237 will continue to act as a stiff resistance. We believe that after the sharp rally, Litecoin will be range-bound for the next few days. Notwithstanding, if the bulls’ breakout to new lifetime highs, then the next target objective on the upside is a rally to $497.53. Though Dash has not run away to its target of $1,199.01, it’s sustaining above $815 levels, which is a positive indication. Bears attempted to push the cryptocurrency back below $815 levels on Dec. 15, however, they were unsuccessful.  This increases the possibility of an upside breakout of $979 and a rally towards the target objective. The bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency falls and sustains below $815.

133,2017-12-18 20:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash: Price Analysis, December 18","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Thy cryptomarket is definitely heading to the moon, reaching $600 bln of total capitalization.   Now, with Bitcoin futures trading on both the CBOE and the CME, Bitcoin has become available to the larger players with big pockets, which includes short sellers. It will be interesting to see what will happen with the cryptocurrency when the first bear attack. However, Ronnie Moas the founder of Standpoint Research has forecast Bitcoin to reach $300,000-$400,000. He advocates investing into the cryptocurrency on every dip. On the other hand, UBS and ING have again warned that Bitcoin owners will lose their money. However, these calls by the large banks will have to be taken with a pinch of salt because they have been warning of a bubble from the start of the year and the digital currency is up about 19 times from there. Interestingly, the French Finance Minister wants to discuss Bitcoin at the next G20 summit in April 2018. A lot seems to be happening in the cryptocurrency universe. We are in for interesting times ahead. But first, let’s see what does the picture look like for the next few days. In our previous analysis, we had suggested that the cryptocurrency will face resistance at the $20,000 mark and that is what happened.  Yesterday, Bitcoin reached a high of $19,531.90, before cooling off to $17,900. We expect to see some volatility for the next couple of days. The uptrend and the momentum remain intact as long as the virtual currency trades above the trendline. Our upside target for the cryptocurrency stands at $24,291.58.   However, if the trendline support breaks, Bitcoin will become weak. It will become bearish and indicate a larger fall once it falls below $15,200 levels. What is the downside target? Once the 20-day EMA breaks, the digital currency can fall to the 50-day SMA, which is currently at about $10,333 levels. Therefore, traders should trade with a stop-loss. On Dec. 16, we said that a range bound action is likely. However, the bulls are slowly nudging price towards the lifetime highs.  The cryptocurrency will resume its uptrend if the bulls manage to sustain above $780. The upside target following a breakout to lifetime highs is $995.99. On the other hand, if the bears push Ethereum back from the highs, it is likely to consolidate between $610.03 on the downside or $780 on the upside. We had expected Bitcoin Cash to gain momentum once it broke out of the range. However, it did not happen. The cryptocurrency was stuck in a small range for three days. Nevertheless, the bulls kept the price above the critical support of $1,758. Hence, we had recommended keeping the positions open. After three days of range contraction, the range expanded today and propelled the cryptocurrency towards our target objective of $2,387. There is no significant resistance between the current levels and the lifetime highs. Therefore, we recommend that the traders trail their stops higher rather than book profits at the target levels because if the momentum sustains, a rally to new lifetime highs is also possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency sinks into the range once again. Therefore, please raise the stop-loss to $1,700. We expected to see an attempt to break out of the highs. However, the bulls are lacking momentum at higher levels. Similarly, the bears are unable to sink the digital currency below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $0.63051. When we see buying at lower levels and profit booking at higher levels, it results in a range bound action. We expect to see Ripple trade between $0.63051 on the downside and $0.88268 on the upside. The next move will start either on a breakout or breakdown of the range. Until then, the cryptocurrency will remain volatile inside a range.    For the past three days, IOTA has formed a consecutive inside day candlestick pattern. This is similar to the coiling effect of the spring. Today, the cryptocurrency has broken out to the upside, which is a bullish sign. The downtrend line is the final resistance, above which, we can expect a retest of the highs.  However, if the price fails to sustain above the downtrend line, we anticipate a fall towards the $3.032 levels once again. IOTA will become negative once it breaks below this critical support. After yesterday’s up move, Litecoin is forming a Doji candlestick pattern today. This shows an equilibrium between the bulls and the bears. In our previous analysis, we had forecast a range bound trading in Litecoin and that is likely to continue for the next few days. Support exists at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $243.86. Similarly, the bears are likely to offer a strong resistance at the highs of $342.23. The bull run will resume on a breakout and close above the lifetime highs. That will open a target potential of $497.53. We had a target objective of $1,199 and that level was reached yesterday when Dash made a new lifetime high of $1,250. However, higher levels are attracting profit booking. Yesterday, the cryptocurrency gave up half of its gains and closed well below its intraday highs. Therefore, we believe that a short-term top is around the corner. We expect a range bound action in Dash. The broad range is between $900 on the lower end and $1,250 on the upper end. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

134,2017-12-20 19:40:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash: Price Analysis, December 20","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   New highs for Ethereum, Dash, Bitcoin Cash! Going short or long?   When stock prices of companies surge, just by adding the word ‘cryptocurrency’ or ‘Bitcoin’ to their name or by announcing entry into the Blockchain technology or sometimes by pure speculation, it is a sign that things are getting out of hand. During such times, short sellers like Andrew Left, founder at Citron Research look at strategies that will help them to benefit from the fall. Similarly, we believe that with the sharp rise in Bitcoin in 2017, a few short sellers will be salivating to short in the futures market once the upside momentum wanes. However, will it lead to long liquidation or will the short sellers be forced to cover leading to a squeeze is difficult to predict. Another thing of interest will be to see whether the altcoins hold out or are dragged down along with the leader. Let’s try to find it out. In our previous analysis, we had warned the readers about a likely increase in volatility. We had also advised trading with stops because the cryptocurrency was at a risk of a deeper correction if it were to break below the critical support. The cryptocurrency has broken down of the uptrend line. This confirms a break in the momentum. Today, Bitcoin came close to its critical support of $15,200 and bounced from there. Now, the rebound will face resistance at the trendline, which previously had acted as a strong support. If the price fails to rise above the trendline, chances are that it will break down of $15,200. The lower targets are $12,505 and then $10,760 which is the 50-day SMA support. The negative divergence on the RSI also points to a likely fall in Bitcoin. Our bearish view will be invalidated if Bitcoin climbs back above the trendline. We had hinted that the bulls were attempting to breakout above the lifetime highs. On Dec. 18, Ethereum reached a new lifetime high.  However, the highs did not fix as profit booking and selling forced the cryptocurrency back below $780. The support exists from the trendline. If this level breaks, we can expect deeper fall. On the other hand, if the digital currency moves above $800, it will rally towards its target objective of $995.99. Contrarily, if the bears push Ethereum back from the highs, it is likely to consolidate between $610.03 on the downside or $780 on the upside. We have long positions in Bitcoin Cash from $1,520 levels. We had recommended the readers to trail their stops higher, instead of booking profits at the target levels of $2,387 and the lifetime highs. What should you do when you are sitting on 100 percent profits within a short span of time? You book partial profits and trail the stops on the rest. So, the traders should book about 50 percent profits on their existing positions, keeping in mind that the cryptocurrency can rally even from the current levels. We have seen that the last time, Bitcoin Cash had plunged after making a new lifetime high. Hence, it is better to pocket some of the gains rather than leave everything on the table. The remaining position can be trailed with a stop loss of $2,400. We need to subsequently raise it as the rally continues. How high can Bitcoin Cash go? The next target on the upside is $4,514.5173. Our assumption of a volatile range-bound trading action on Ripple has also turned out to be correct. Yesterday, higher levels saw profit booking and today, along with buying at lower levels.  As a result, the cryptocurrency is forming a pennant pattern. If the price breaks this formation out forming new highs, we are likely to see a resumption of the uptrend. On the other hand, if Ripple breaks down the formation, chances are that we will see a slide to the 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally. It is very difficult to predict the movement within the formation, as it is likely to remain volatile.    We had pointed out about the range tightening from Dec. 14 to Dec. 17. We expected a sharp move thereafter, once IOTA broke out of the downtrend line. The cryptocurrency has retested the highs, according to our expectations. Now what? Currently, the highs are offering a stiff resistance. We can expect a consolidation near the highs for the next couple of days. If the next attempt to break out to new high succeeds, a rally to $8 levels is expected. On the other hand, if the price fails to break out, IOTA will become range bound between $3 and $5.5. We expected the bull run to resume on a breakout and close above the lifetime highs. However, our assumption turned out to be wrong, because Litecoin broke out to new highs on Dec. 18 but could not sustain at higher levels. Yesterday, the price fell back into the range and has gone lower today. We believe that the cryptocurrency will consolidate between $243.86 and $370 levels for the next few days. A breach of either level is likely to start a new trend. Until then, range-bound action will continue. We had anticipated a range bound action on Dash. But the cryptocurrency surged new highs yesterday. The breakout of $1,250 gave a target objective of $1,500, which was reached today. Forecasting the next higher targets is difficult. Therefore, it might be a good idea for traders to trail their stops higher. Currently, a fall below $1,200 will be a negative development; hence, this level can act as an SL. That’s why we believe that a short-term top is around the corner. We again expect a range bound action in Dash with the broad range between $900 on the lower end and $1,250 on the upper end.

135,2017-12-22 19:02:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash: Price Analysis, December 22","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Although 30% down, the crypto market remains strong. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto market has fallen by  more than 30 percent. There is a combination of events that might have triggered it. Litecoin’s founder selling all his coins in this rally is certainly a sentiment breaker. This might look like he believes the elevated levels were a good position to cash out completely. While his selling doesn’t end the future of Litecoin, it certainly dampens the sentiment and we can see it reflect on the other cryptocurrencies as well. Elsewhere, a large individual trader or a group of traders placed an options bet on the New York-based digital currency trading platform LedgerX, that Bitcoin will rally above $50,000 by end-2018. Right now, it seems to be an overly optimistic assumption. However, anything can happen in a year’s time. If someone had told me in January 2017 that Bitcoin will climb close to $20,000 during the year, I would not have believed it. Nonetheless, the bull market tops out when the sentiment is overly bullish, especially with the retail traders. Using the Wayback Machine, we find that the whales have been trimming their positions, while the smaller traders have been piling on Bitcoin over the period of the year. Professional’s selling is never a good sign. Though in the past year, every fall has been a buying opportunity and the aggressive bulls have made a lot of money, we believe that, now, the traders should wait and not venture out to buy until we see some semblance of a support forming. But won’t we miss out buying at lower levels? We may! But, we will also sleep peacefully and enjoy the holidays without any major worry, should the cryptocurrencies extend their fall. We have not traded in Bitcoin for a while because we did not get the right setup to enter. Though we missed out on a large uptrend, at least we did not get caught in the frenzy. To the lucky few who are owning Bitcoin, we have warned in our previous two analysis reports that the cryptocurrency is at a risk of breaking down.  In our previous analysis, we had warned that if Bitcoin failed to rise above the trendline, it will break below $15,200 and that is what happened. The attempt to rebound off $15,200 failed on Dec. 20 and today the cryptocurrency has plunged even below our expected support levels of $12,505. We may find a number of aggressive bulls buy at the current levels of the BTC/USD pair and continue buying till the 50-day SMA of $11,000. However, we believe that we shouldn’t try to catch a falling knife. As the selling has been overdone, we may find a bounce soon, but, if it fails to sustain, it’ll break loose. We may see the fall extend to even $10,000 levels. So, let’s wait for the correction to end before initiating any long positions. We had warned the traders of a deeper fall, should Ethereum breakdown of the trendline. Today, it did and plunged.  The ETH/USD pair has a strong support at $500 and below that at the 50-day SMA at $455. If these also don’t hold, then the price will fall to $400 levels. We suggest waiting for a few days until Ethereum forms a bottom. Currently, there are no buy setups on it. Traders who followed us on Bitcoin Cash entered long positions at $1,520 and exited 50 percent positions at a handsome profit of $3,859 and the remaining position was closed at $2,400, which was our trailing stop loss. Though our revised target objective was $4,514.5173, we recommended booking partial profits because Bitcoin Cash has a history of plunging from the highs.  The BCH/USD pair rose to a high of $4,139.0893 and reversed course. It has broken below the 20-day EMA and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally from $1,145 to $4,139.0893. We expect the cryptocurrency to find some support at the 78.6 percent retracement levels of $1,785. However, this is only an expectation. We should take any fresh position only when Bitcoin Cash forms a bottom. Until then, we recommend staying on the sidelines.   In our previous analysis, we had forecast that Ripple will resume its uptrend once it breaks out of the pennant formation. Yesterday, the cryptocurrency broke out of the bullish pennant and skyrocketed higher.  The pattern target of the bullish formation breakout was $1.5 and yesterday, the XRP/USD pair rallied close to a high of $1.2. However, today, it is being clobbered. It is because of this possibility that we keep mentioning to trail the stops higher. As it has broken below the pennant formation, it has become negative. It is difficult to call a bottom, but it may find some support at the $0.6 mark.     We had expected range-bound trading in IOTA unless it broke out and closed above the overhead resistance. However, the bears have a firm grip on the IOTA/USD pair.  Today, the cryptocurrency broke down of the lower end of the range. At one point, the fall had extended to $1.1. In such a volatile environment, we would not like to venture out and buy. The sentiment is too negative. We shall wait for the selling to exhaust before initiating any buy position. It is useless to mention any support levels when traders are selling in a panic. We had forecast a range bound movement between $243.86 and $370. While yesterday, the cryptocurrency bounced off the supports, it was not spared today.  Litecoin is currently at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level, which is a critical support for the LTC/USD pair. If this breaks, we can see the fall extend to the $146.414 levels, which is the 78.6 percent retracement of the rally. We don’t want to be brave during a panic. We want to wait and watch for buying to emerge before initiating any position. We foresaw a short-term top in Dash in our previous analysis and it has been falling ever since.  We expect a strong support at the trendline in, which is just below the 78.6 percent retracement level for the DASH/USD pair. We expect this level to hold. However, we don’t recommend buying until the decline ends. The cryptocurrencies can easily overshoot on the downside. Please note that after such a sharp fall, we are bound to see strong bounces on a few cryptocurrencies. However, we believe in safeguarding our capital first and investing with a calculated risk. With this philosophy, we miss many trades; however, we are less prone to drawdowns as well. At least, let’s enjoy the holidays without any stress. *The market data is provided by TradingView.

136,2017-12-26 18:21:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Dec. 26: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Bitcoin and altcoins are gaining their positions, see what trading moves might be a good idea right now.   Even after the massive correction last week, Bitcoin is likely to end 2017 with huge gains. However, the big question is whether Bitcoin can continue its scintillating run in 2018. While there is no definite answer, most believe that the current correction is a buying opportunity as the bull run is likely to extend next year. Cryptocurrency Entrepreneur Julian Hosp expects Bitcoin to reach $60,000 next year, but he also sees the cryptocurrency falling to $5,000 in 2018. The problem is that he is not sure, which level will be reached first. Hopefully, we will be able to forecast the movements for our readers. While the cryptocurrency enthusiasts are working towards integrating them into mainstream activities, the regulators are creating various obstacles. This is likely to escalate in 2018. However, as traders, we try to profit from every possible situation and cryptocurrency movement. So, after souring the Christmas celebrations, will Bitcoin give the investors an opportunity to cheer the New Year? Let’s find out. According to our expectation, the aggressive bulls bought the dips to the 50-day SMA. After three days of volatile trading, the cryptocurrency is attempting to resume its uptrend today.  On Dec. 22 and Dec. 24, the bulls aggressively bought the dips between $13,000 and $11,000 levels, which resulted in the formation of long tails on the candlesticks. So, for now, $11,000 is likely to act as a short-term bottom. However, will the BTC/USD pair rally back to the highs? Unlikely? The pullback is likely to face resistance in the zone between $15,118.45 and $16,160.02, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracements. From this resistance zone, we expect a dip back towards the recent lows. The next fall towards the $11,000 level will give us a better idea of the uptrend. Nevertheless, all throughout 2017, Bitcoin has always surprised us by rallying to new highs after every dip. Therefore, if the price breaks out of $16,160.02 levels, chances are that it will retest the highs. However, we think there are low chances of that happening. Though we expected Ethereum to find support at the $500 mark, the strong pullback surprised us. Since the past three days, the cryptocurrency is attempting to resume its uptrend.  It has broken out of the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent fall. There is a minor resistance at $787.89, above which a retest of the highs is possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair falls and sustains below $650. In our previous analysis, we had said that Bitcoin Cash would find support at the $1,785 levels and that is what happened. However, we had not expected such a sharp pullback; hence, we did not recommend a buy.  After the plunge on Dec. 22, the cryptocurrency has entered into a small range. It is facing selling around the $3,200 mark, whereas, it is gaining support close to the $2,300 levels. The intraday range has shrunk since yesterday. Within a couple of days, we believe there’ll be a large range move. If the BCH/USD pair breaks out of $3,200, we expect it to retest the highs once again, with a small resistance around the $3,650 levels. If, however, the digital currency breaks down of $2,300, a fall to $1,600 is likely. Ripple plunged on Dec. 22, but it found strong support at $0.67. From there, it rallied 57 percent to close at $1.05398. This confirms a strong underlying demand for it.  The XRP/USD pair has been consolidating for the past three days. Within the next couple of days, we expect the cryptocurrency to attempt to move up. The chart pattern suggests another leg up, which should carry it to new lifetime highs of $1.5. Our bullish view will be invalidated if Ripple falls below the trendline support.     IOTA has remained within the range of $3.032 on the lower end and $5.59 on the upper end since Dec. 6. Attempts to sustain below the supports of the range failed.  The dips below the range saw strong buying, both on Dec. 22 and Dec. 24. As the breakdown of the range failed, we expect the bulls to push the cryptocurrency towards the upper end of the range at $5.59. Our bullish view will be proven wrong if the IOT/USD pair falls and sustains below $3.032 levels. While Litecoin dipped below the support levels of $240 on Dec. 2, it quickly recovered and closed above this level.  It is currently facing resistance around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of $272.6. We anticipate selling in the zone of $272.60 and $292.589. However, if it breaks out of $300, we can expect a retest of the highs. On the other hand, failure of breakout above $300 will keep the LTC/USD pair range-bound between $240 and $300. The fall on Dec. 22 found support close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels. On Dec. 24, the 20-day EMA acted as a strong support.  For the past two days, the cryptocurrency has been facing resistance at the $1,200 mark. If the bulls manage to break out and sustain above this overhead resistance, we expect a move to $1,338.50, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent fall. Above this, a retest of the highs is likely. The DASH/USD pair will become negative if it declines below $1,000 levels. We expect volatile trading due to the holiday season. We believe that the cryptocurrencies markets will make a decisive move next week onwards when the traders return back to work. So, please keep the allocation sizes small until then. *The market data is provided by TradingView.

137,2017-12-28 20:22:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash, Monero: Price Analysis, Dec.28","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Still down? Why the crypto market is so volatile right now and what to do about it.   The market has been volatile over the last couple of days. Does the change in behavior signal a possibility of a further fall? We shall try to forecast it using our chart analysis. The South Korean government’s proposed regulations and curbs on cryptocurrency trading have dampened the sentiment. After all, the nation with a relatively small geographical territory is responsible for a sizeable trading volume, about one-fifth by some measures, in Bitcoin. Nick Colas, one of the first Wall Street analysts to cover Bitcoin, believes that 2018 will see a surge in volatility with about  40 percent falls. If that happens, timing the markets become that much more important. A buy and hold strategy, similar to 2017, might not be the best way to trade Bitcoin. We shall try to identify these turning points for our traders so that they don’t get stuck with huge losses. In our previous analysis, we had mentioned that Bitcoin’s pullback will face a strong hurdle between $15,118.45 and $16,160.02. Yesterday, Bitcoin turned down after reaching $16,494.53.  The cryptocurrency has a strong support at the trendline. We expect the bulls to attempt a recovery from here. If they are able to break out of $16,494.53 levels, we should see a retest of the highs. On the other hand, if the BTC/USD pair breaks down of the trendline, it can fall to $12,788.14 levels, which is a critical support zone. Though not perfect, the digital currency is forming a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below the neckline (drawn in orange color on the chart). However, we expect strong buying support to emerging between $10,704.99 to $12,788.14. With conflicting signals, we are unsure about the next possible direction in Bitcoin. We shall watch the action from the sidelines until the picture clears out. Ethereum is facing selling in the $728.92 - $787.89 zone, which corresponds to 61.8 percent and 78.6 percent retracement levels of the recent fall from $863 to $512.  The digital currency is now likely to fall to the 20-day EMA, which should offer a strong support. However, if negative sentiment prevails and the cryptocurrency breaks below the 20-day EMA, its next support is at $600 levels. We will attempt a buy on the ETH/USD pair only when it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line (the orange line drawn on the chart). Bitcoin Cash is resuming its decline after failing to breakout and sustain above the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $4,139.0893 to $1,733.3558.    The cryptocurrency has a strong support at the $2,300 levels. However, if the bears are able to break down below this level, a fall to the 50-day SMA is likely. On the other hand, if the bulls hold the $2,300 levels, the BCH/USD pair will remain range-bound for a few days between $2,300 and $3,200. We shall wait for a clear trend to form before recommending any trade on it. In our previous analysis, we foresaw a resumption of the Ripple uptrend. As expected, the cryptocurrency made a new lifetime high yesterday and is on its way up once again.  If the bulls manage to sustain above the $1.24950 levels, the XRP/USD pair should rally towards its target objective of $1.5. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks below the trendline support. As the sentiment across most other cryptocurrencies is negative, traders who are long Ripple should trade with an appropriate stop loss.     We anticipated an up move in IOTA to carry it towards the upper end of the range. However, yesterday’s attempt to rally faced strong selling pressure above the $3.75 mark. Today, the digital currency is back at the support levels of $3.03200 once again.  As the bulls failed to push the cryptocurrency higher, the bears will now attempt to breakdown of the range. If the IOTA/USD pair breaks down and closes below the range, its uptrend will be in danger. The final support zone is between the 50-day SMA and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $2.62196. Below this, IOTA can plunge to $1.81512 levels. On the other hand, if the bears are unable to sustain below the support of the range, the cryptocurrency will remain range bound between $3.36990 and $5.59. The pullback in Litecoin has been facing selling pressure at the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $272.6. An attempt to break out of this resistance failed on Dec. 26 and Dec. 27. The cryptocurrency has turned down to the critical support of $240.001 once again.  The LTC/USD pair has also formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern with the neckline at $240. If this level breaks, the pair has a lower pattern target of $110. However, we don’t see a straight slide to the target objective. The bulls will attempt to hold the supports at $220 and $175.199. Whether the supports hold is difficult to predict. Our bearish view will be invalidated once the digital currency trades above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of $295.586. Yesterday, Dash attempted to breakout of the overhead resistance of $1,200 but failed. The pullback could not even reach the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of $1,250. This shows weakness.    Today, the cryptocurrency has resumed its decline. It is currently taking support at the 20-day EMA. If this support fails, a fall to the trendline is likely. We expect the trendline to offer a strong support. However, until we see the DASH/USD pair forming a bottom, we shall stay on the sidelines. Monero rallied sharply from a low of $83.02 on November 03 to a high of $469.5 on Dec. 20. That’s a massive 465 percent rally in about a month and a half.  The correction on Dec. 21 and Dec. 22 plunged the cryptocurrency to a low of $245.1, just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. However, lower levels saw strong buying, which helped the XMR/USD pair to recover and pullback to $410 on Dec. 23. However, the bears are selling at higher levels and the bulls are buying at lower levels. This is likely to lead to a range-bound trading action until one party relents. Critical levels to watch on the downside are $320 and $300 and on the upside, is $410. Monero will become bearish if it breaks down of the supports and will become bullish if it breaks out of the overhead resistance. *The market data is provided by TradingView.

News Cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) shot up by almost 35 percent over the past 24 hours, trading at an average of $2.20 and occupying second place by market cap in the overall crypto market at press time. The massive spike comes just over a week after the coin broke $1 for the first time last Thursday. The price then dropped again on Dec. 22, but rallied back up 57 percent the same day and has been following a bullish run since blowing past $1.50 today.  With a market cap now of $78 bln- Ripple is worth more than Uber, valued at $68 bln as of December 2017 according to the Wall Street Journal. The cryptocurrency was trading stably at about $0.20 for the past six months, starting its notable growth on Dec. 12.  The investment profitability of Ripple, created in 2013, this year has surpassed that of Bitcoin.

139,2017-12-30 17:00:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Becomes Largest Altcoin As Bitcoiners Issue Warnings,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Ripple is causing a stir on both the markets and social media as its price continues to explode. Brief Ripple (XRP) has overtaken Ethereum as the largest altcoin by market cap in a surge which has divided the cryptocurrency community. After the payment network’s token reached as much as $2.65 on some exchanges this week, investors are celebrating returns which have topped 1,000 percent in just three weeks. At the start of December, XRP traded at just $0.24. Multiple altcoins have seen astronomical gains towards the end of this year as Bitcoin’s own surge fueled copycat behavior which saw new all-time highs for assets including Monero, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. With a market cap of $91 bln at press time Saturday, however, it is XRP that has stolen the show from Ethereum, which currently has a market cap of $68 bln. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s overall market share has sunk to new all-time lows below 38 percent. Reasons for Ripple’s rise revolve around new partnerships with traditional finance, institutions keen to leverage its technology to cut costs and save time. Despite its newfound successes, however, Bitcoin figures appear wearier than ever, highlighting the project’s centralized structure and comparative lack of use cases for XRP versus the platform itself. “There is a clear mispricing here between the (past) and the (future),” BitFury CEO George Kikvadze commented on Twitter Friday. Ripple - Centralised Solution; Trust in One Company - Worth $100Bln?Bitcoin - Decentralised Solution; Trust in Mathematics and Cryptography - Worth $235Bln?There is a clear mispricing here between the PAST and the FUTURE Popular personality WhalePanda meanwhile went further, comparing Ripple’s ethos in terms of bonafide Blockchain qualities to notorious MMM scheme OneCoin. If you really believe Ripple, which isnt even a blockchain project, is the future of cryptocurrencies... then I have some Bitconnect and Onecoin to sell to you. Placeholder VC’s Chris Burniske and Blockchain technologist Preston Byrne also voiced concerns about the rate of XRP’s growth.

140,2017-12-30 20:05:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash, Monero: Price Analysis, Dec. 30","  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Our last price analysis this year. See what price movement to expect and what orders to make during the holidays.   Cryptocurrencies have generated wealth for the traders like no other asset class. While Bitcoin has garnered most of the attention, it is not the only one to have risen in 2017. There have been scores of winners. Ethereum was the second leading currencies aiming to overtake Bitcoin as the dominant leader of the year; it could never really achieve the feat. However, within the past two weeks, Ripple has skyrocketed from a low of $0.22 on Dec. 10, to a high of $2.47 today. That’s a whopping rally of 1024 percent within a span of 20 days. As a result, Ripple has now overtaken Ethereum as the second most valuable currency by market capitalization. Bitcoin’s dominance, which had risen above 60 percent just a few weeks back has again cooled off to 38.3 percent. As the market matures, we are likely to see a number of changes in the rankings of these currencies. Therefore, one has to keep an open mind towards all the cryptocurrencies because as traders; our main goal is to earn money. So, do we have any good buy setups for the end of the year or is it best to remain on the sidelines and enjoy the holidays, returning to trade in the new year? Let’s find out. We expected a pullback from the trendline, however, due to lack of buyers, the recovery never gained strength. Today, the bears easily broke below the trendline support, which has escalated the selling. Bitcoin has broken down of the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern. If the cryptocurrency sustains below the neckline, it has a pattern target of $5,745. However, we don’t expect to see such a plunge in the short-term. We believe that the bulls will attempt to defend the recent lows of $10,704.99.  But if they fail, the bears are likely to intensify their selling. A number of long positions will start to bleed, which is likely to lead to panic selling. We see another support at the $8,000 mark. All these lower levels will come into play only if the BTC/USD pair breaks and sustains below the 50-day SMA. Contrarily, if the bears are unable to breakdown of the 50-day SMA, we may see a recovery in the new year. Yet, we will prefer to wait until the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line to initiate any position. We don’t find any trades at the current price. We mentioned that Ethereum will become positive in the short-term only on a breakout and close above the downtrend line. Yesterday, the bulls broke out of the trendline but could not manage a close above it. On the downside, the 20-day EMA has been providing a strong support. If this support level breaks, we may see a slide towards $646.08 and thereafter to $600 levels. On the other hand, the ETH/USD pair will become positive above $770 because it has returned from the $760 levels on three occasions. Between the 20-day EMA and $760, we are likely to witness a volatile range-bound trading action. Therefore, we suggest waiting until we get a clear breakout and a confirmation of the resumption of the uptrend. For the past two days, the bulls had been defending the $2300 mark. But their attempt to resume the rally failed yesterday.    Today, the bears have broken down of the critical support level of $2300. The next downside target on the BCH/USD pair is a fall to the 50-day SMA. We expect a strong buying around the $1,733 levels.  Nonetheless, we recommend waiting until there is a clear bottom in sight. Consider avoiding buying in a falling market. Ripple roared past our initial target objective of $1.5. Today, it reached an intraday high of $2.474. Traders who had purchased on our bullish prediction should close their positions or at least trail with a close stop loss depending on their strategy. After such a stellar rally, we expect the XRP/USD pair to enter into a correction or a consolidation. Therefore, we don’t have any fresh buy recommendations on it.     The bulls have successfully held on to the lower end of the range at $3.032 for the past few days. However, they have not been able to push the cryptocurrency higher. Today, the IOTA/USD pair is again under a bear attack, which is threatening to break below the critical support. If the bears succeed, the cryptocurrency will fall to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $2.62196. Yet, if the bulls manage to hold the supports once again today, IOTA will continue to trade inside the range. We shall initiate buy positions only on a breakout and close above the downtrend line. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines. The bears have broken below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. Unless the bulls stage takes a sharp recovery today, chances are that Litecoin will continue lower in the next few days.   We anticipate a strong support at the recent lows of $175.199. The 50-day SMA is also just below this level, which should also provide some support. However, if both these levels fail to hold, the LTC/USD pair will fall towards $110, which is the target objective of the breakdown of the head and shoulders pattern. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls manage to push the digital currency above the neckline at $240. For the past two days, the bulls managed to hold on to the 20-day EMA. But today, the bears have broken below the moving average support.   Dash has a strong support at the trendline. We expect the bulls to strongly defend this level. Though we shall avoid buying until we get a confirmation of a bottom formation because if the trendline breaks, the DASH/USD pair can fall to $800 and thereafter to $650 levels. We were expecting a range-bound trading action in Monero. Despite that, the bears have taken control and have broken below the 20-day EMA today, which is a bearish development. The immediate support on Monero is at $300. If this level breaks down, we are likely to see the decline extend to the recent lows of $245.1. The 50-day SMA is also at this level. Just below there is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $230.66. We expect a strong support in this zone. At the same time, we don’t suggest buying until the fall is arrested. When the markets are in a bear grip, it is a good strategy to wait until the decline ends, instead of being brave and attempting to catch a falling knife. The market data is provided by TradingView.

Having reached the $3,000 area, the price corrected to an upward trend of $2,400. Yesterday’s events influenced the correction. It was instant but quite consistent. Bitcoin did not manage to form a turn downwards at the fall peak and therefore we observed a reversal up.  If a major buyer, who purchased from $2,400, is still holding their positions, then, in the case of a fall to $2,660, the price will rebound up. Note that the number of pending buy orders exceeds the volume of orders to sale for more than a day now. If there’s no support for an upward trend, there will a turn down at $2,660 and the price will move down to $2,450, at least. Ethereum price continues to build up the uptrend structure confidently. There has been a significant increase in demand around $200. This allowed the price to stay after the breakdown of the key level at the $220 area.  An upward trend from $176 will continue until its structure is broken. Breaking it would mean that the advantage is with the bears. At the moment, it might take place at around $210. If a large buyer keeps his positions at this trend, then after a pullback to this zone, we’ll see a rebound and the growth will continue. Otherwise, Ethereum price will form a downward turn. Ripple price seems to be indicating the exit from the $0.155 to $0.175 flat. The demand volume has increased, but this growth is still difficult to call a reversal.  The price needs to settle at the upper border of the chart. Thus, it will show the obvious advantage of the buyers. If the price does not form a reversal down to $0.17, then it might move up. At a turn downwards, XRP will become flat. Litecoin is also growing a bit insecure. The price failed to settle or form a full-fledged correction. Instead, we see is a sharp decline. This suggests the demand level is not high enough. The volume of pending orders proves the point.  Litecoin price needs settling, which will indicate prominent demand volume. The current upward structure may be broken with a downward turn in the $41 area. This is the point responsible for the entire upward trend structure from $38. Ethereum Classic is trying to form an upward trend, though unsuccessful so far. Given the fact that orders to sale prevail, the price has deep resistance moving up. The current growth is the correction to the $17 downtrend.  The advantage is on the sellers’ side, that’s why a turning point will alter the trend. It will happen if ETC settles at around $15.8 and forms a turn-up. Until then, while the downtrend structure is not broken, the price will be falling.

The demand volume during the formation was less compared to the previous figures. Thus the $2,800 zone does not seem to be interesting for the majority of buyers. They seem to be waiting for the pullback.  If we look at the horizontal trading volume, it is clear, the $2,790 area has had rather large purchases. The last pullback was also seen at this point. If there is no downward turn at the $2,650 level, the price might move up. But if while pullback there’s a reversal, there might be drop to the $2,700 area. Ethereum price has formed a reversal wave with increased demand level, and there’s a correction right now. Also, this week's wave started with a short-term $176.5 to $210 reversal wave.  If the price does go up, it will pass the $265 mark, but it’s possible only in case this week’s uptrend. The $217 area is essential for the trend-like movement. Provided there’s no reversal during the pullback, the growth will be supported. Otherwise, Ethereum will have a flat down to $200. Ripple price has settled at the key $0.17 mark. At the moment it’s the most likely correction peak. In general, XRP has formed a reversal wave up.  Demand volumes look positive. We also see the amount of pending buy orders top up sell orders. Given there’s no reversal during the pullback to $0.17, chances are XRP price will go up. But a reversal down at the $0.17 point will undermine the whole uptrend structure. Usually, in this case, the price moves down. Litecoin’s insecure growth can turn into a sharp fall. Flat-like upward movement doesn’t look a trend now.  The key level is at the $41.9 area. If this mark proves itself important for major buyers in the future, a rebound and further growth will take place, when the price reaches this mark. But price settling and a downward turn at this channel will mean large trading volumes do not support the price there. Ethereum Classic has chances to form an upward turn. The price is reaching a turning point that will define the future trend.  The price is yet to form a reversal wave up at the $15.5 area; some major sales were made at this point. We saw large purchase volume in the $14.5 area in the past. If this level is still interesting to buyers, there will be no reversal, and Ethereum Classic price will rebound up, once it is reached.

Bitcoin price is forming the third wave of $1,838 mid-term uptrend. Currently, it is being decided whether we’ll see a big price hike or downwards correction to $2,800  The third wave can become the turning point. If there are new capital flows, BTC will move up. The key level responsible for the whole future of the uptrend is at $3,150. Providing no reversal down takes place during the pullback to the level, high chances the rise will remain. Otherwise, the price will have a reversal to the correction. Ethereum price has similar structure forming. The demand levels show significantly lower numbers, compared to the first wave. This may trigger a pullback.  The $246 point is breaking for the whole trend. If the price corrects to this channel without a reversal downwards, it will mean, there are still big purchases in place. In this case, ETH will go up. A reversal down at the $246 point will indicate major buyer closing positions. That way the price might have a pullback. Ripple is in the midst of its $0.1542 uptrend correction. It is being traded at the most likely pullback bottom.   Correction zone to the $0.1542 upward trend will take place till $0.17. XRP might speed up the growth. But the correction peak might be broken at $0.177 in case of a pullback. Litecoin has a big supply level at the current peak. That’s why we see an upwards trend forming.  The $45 mark will indicate whether the trend will be broken and whether it will have a reversal down. A correction peak has been formed to the $13.2 uptrend with Ethereum Price. The demand level exceeds the previous figures, and this is a good sign for further growth.  The structure needs to keep on. Otherwise, there’ll be a reversal at $13.2 and the price might fall to the starting point.

SegWit has locked-in today. Now the network has to update its software to make sure all the SegWit transactions are stable. And there’s almost a month before the SegWit implementation.  Bitcoin price is indicating the first signs that the trend might break. This can also mean that the trend of a larger scale is in place. But $3,220 will be the turning point, as this is the last mark of the $2,619 uptrend. If there’s no reversal down, the price rise is highly likely to last. Otherwise, Bitcoin will experience deeper correction. It seems like Ethereum price has established almost reversal-free structure. The current pullback might result in bigger correction.  The upwave might get higher. But it’s important this structure remains, as capital infusion at key points helps form this trend. If there is no infusion and profits are locked in, the trend ends. This is what may happen at the current key point, $280. With a major trader locking in their profits, Ethereum will undergo deeper correction. But without any reversal at this level, the price will rise. Ripple price managed to make a new upwards wave but had no luck in settling. It looks like there’s no support at $0.19, so it may lead to deeper fall.  After the price fell from $0.2, current growth can be considered a flat wave. So the present wave down is, in fact, the $0.17 to $0.19 flat wave too. For this wave to stop, it needs to have a reversal at  $0.186; we see large sell orders there. If Ripple fails to have a reversal upwards at this point, correction stays. A sharp impulse up has ended the flat wave. The reversal at the lowest border did not happen, and this kept the trend-like structure going.  Currently, Ripple price is in the correction and if the price settles here, the growth will keep on. In case the reversal at $45.5, the point with the biggest trading and pending purchase orders volume, does take place we’ll see the whole $38 upward trend break. Ethereum Classic flat has been going on for almost a week and its exit will form a trend of the same scale.  Right now the volume of pending buy orders surpasses the amount of sell orders. It indicates strong resistance to the price falling in case of a downwards reversal. But without the reversal at the $15 flat border, the price rise is highly anticipated.

Bitcoin price has formed one more uptrend wave. The rise in demand didn’t lead to the full-scale correction. That is why this trend is expected to last.  The $3,220 upwave may become the premises for flat, but this wave structure has to be broken. The current key level with the most trading volume is $3,400. The price might turn into flat if Bitcoin has a reversal down at this level. Ethereum is traded at the peak of the uptrend correction.  After a significant fall from $316, it may start deeper correction to the upward trend. The $295 mark is defining for the price future. Ripple has reached the key mid term level, which is the most likely peak of the pullback to the upward trend.  After the price settled at $0.175, we saw a sharp price hike. Analyzing the pending orders volume, the sell orders exceed the number of purchase orders. XRP has serious resistance before $0.183. That’s why until there is no upwards reversal, the downward trend will keep on. Litecoin price has formed the full-scale correction to the $38 upward trend. The following price reaction will define the trend.  As a rule, in this cases a price settles, so we might see Litecoin settling at $48. If big sells volumes will follow, there’ll be no reversal up and the fall will last. But settling at $48 along with a reversal up will indicate the rise in demand, which would mean the trend will continue. For Ethereum Classic to form a full-scale correction to the $13.2 upward trend, it would need a breaking of the $14.9 reversal. In the case of a reversal the following growth might be more stable.  The pending buy orders volume is bigger than purchase orders. That’s why a fall to the $14.9 peak and a reversal might stimulate even bigger decrease.

Among the top four cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has taken the lead and is marching ahead, making lifetime new highs on a regular basis, while the others are still far away from their peaks. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has pulled the whole cryptocurrency universe along with it. The total market capitalization of the 843 digital currencies has reached above $132 bln. So, can this bullish trend continue or are we looking at another correction in the short-term? Let’s see what the chart patterns tell us. We start with the leader – Bitcoin. Bitcoin was range bound between $2,999.99 and $1,913.19 for about two and half months. The breakout of the range had a pattern target of $4,086.79, which has been reached. We should see a consolidation or a mild correction of one to three days at the current levels before the uptrend continues.  Therefore, traders who have positions from lower levels might want to book partial profits at the current levels. Avoiding fresh positions seems like a good idea until we see a small dip or a consolidation, which will give a good stop loss point. However, if the momentum continues and Bitcoin breaks out of $4,086.79, it can rally to $4,630.19. Ethereum is presently facing resistance at $323.69 levels, which is just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $420 to $130.26; we are not considering the lows of the flash crash of June 21 for this calculation.  The current fall can extend to $270, where the currency has dual support – from the trendline and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). We can expect this level to hold. Therefore, a buy closer to the trendline with a stop loss just below it may offer a good entry point with a small risk. The first target will be $323.69, above which a move to $381 is possible. If, however, the trendline support breaks, a fall to $215 and $180 is likely. A large descending triangle is forming on the daily chart of XRP/USD. The bearish pattern will complete on a fall below $0.135. In the short-term, however, there is support at $0.15460.  Nevertheless, as Ripple is quoting below both the critical moving averages that are trending down, traders should avoid taking fresh long positions until price breaks out of the downtrend line at $0.20000 and starts a new uptrend. Until then, it’s better to stick with the other currencies that are following a definite trend. After the initial few days of volatility, BCH/USD is currently settling down. As the currency has a short history, we shall use the 240-minute time frame on it.  Presently, the price is moving lower towards the support levels of $280 and $265. The trend will change after the price breaks out of the downtrend line at about the $330 levels. Therefore, it is best to wait for lower levels to initiate fresh positions or wait for the breakout above the trendline.

The cryptocurrency universe has divided experts right in the middle. While one group says that digital currencies are in a bubble, the other group says this is only the start of a multi-year trend. While it’s good to know others’ perspectives, we shall focus on the chart and chart patterns to forecast the next probable direction. The markets may move against our assumption several times, therefore we always advise a stop loss, because the first loss is the best loss. So, let’s get down to analyzing charts.  On Aug. 15, we expected the fall in Bitcoin to push it towards the lower end of the channel. However, the digital currency rose from the trendline, which now becomes a critical support. For the past six days, Bitcoin has been closing above the $4000 levels, which is a sign of strength. A breakout and close above the upper end of the channel will be very bullish, which will give it a pattern target of $5500. However, $4630 and $5000 are likely to act as resistances during the next upmove. Our bullish forecast will be invalidated once Bitcoin breaks and closes below the trendline support. It will then turn the short-term picture negative, where the digital currency can fall to the lower end of the channel. The last two weekends have been bullish for Bitcoin, marked as arrows on the chart. Let’s see if the digital currency can make it three in a row.  Ethereum has performed according to our forecast. It fell to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) where it found support. Traders who entered close to $270 levels on our recommendation should trail their stop loss and book profits above $320 levels, as this has been a strong resistance for the past several days. Fresh positions can be initiated at $330, which will confirm a breakout above the resistance. The initial stop loss for the new trade should be kept at $280, just below the trendline support and the 20-day EMA. The breakout can carry the digital currency to $381 and thereafter to $400 levels. Our bullish view will be negated once the price breaks down of the trendline support.  We had advised long positions on Bitcoin Cash following two closes above the downtrend trendline. This trade too proved to be profitable for our readers. Currently, the digital currency is in a pullback that is likely to be arrested at either $458 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) or extend to $427 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement). Traders can watch for 240-minutes and buy, once the digital currency resumes its uptrend. The next target on the upside is $690. If purchasing around $500 levels, please keep a stop loss of $420. However, if prices correct and the long position is initiated around $420 levels, please keep the stop loss at $390, because a pullback that falls below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels usually retraces the whole rally completely.  Ripple continues to trade inside the bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $0.135 levels. However, if the bearish pattern fails, it is a sign of strength. Therefore, we recommend a long position on a breakout and close above the downtrend line at around $0.2 levels. Until then, it is better to trade other cryptocurrencies that are trending.

Within three weeks of splitting into two, the Bitcoin community looks to be heading towards another split in November. This news has put brakes on the Bitcoin rally and there is a move away from the leader to other altcoins. As a result, Bitcoin’s dominance is down to 45.6 percent, from over 50 percent just a few days back, according to CoinMarketCap. So, will Bitcoin continue to fall? Let’s analyze the charts and find out. Following consecutive closes above $4000, we were expecting a breakout and close above the channel, which never happened. Nevertheless, our second scenario of a fall to the lower end of the channel did play out according to our expectations.  In doing so, Bitcoin completed a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of its recent rise from the lows of $2650 to the highs of $4469. The pullback from the dual support of the channel line and the critical Fibonacci level shows that the bulls are still active at lower levels. However, we don’t find an attractive buy setup at the current levels. The risk-reward is not in favor of the bulls. Though a trade can be taken above the $4000 levels, the stop loss is way deep at $3550 and the initial profit objective is only a retest of the highs at $4469. Due to a large stop loss, we are not advising any buy on the digital currency today. Bitcoin remains bullish as long as it trades in the uptrending channel and above the 20-day exponential moving average and the 50-day simple moving average. The first sign of trouble for the bulls will be when price breaks down and closes below the channel. It will then signal a fall to $3000 levels. Ethereum broke out of the critical resistance of $323 on Monday, however, it could not sustain the rise and closed just below the resistance at $322.  Traders, who went long at $330 levels might want to keep their stops just below the trendline at $280. A breakdown from the trendline and the 20-day EMA at $285 can push Ethereum down to the 50-day SMA at around $245 levels. However, if the bulls again manage to push the digital currency back above the overhead resistance, it will signal underlying strength, which should result in an upside to $381 and thereafter to $400 levels. Traders with a lower risk appetite can close their position if the next attempt to breakout above $323 levels fails and the digital currency again reverses its direction lower. We got Bitcoin Cash right on two occasions. Hopefully, our readers were able to cash in their huge profits.  Now, after the stellar rise from $296.38 to $972, Bitcoin Cash pulled back close to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels where it found support. Since then, the currency has resumed its uptrend. However, we expect to see some range bound action for the next few days. Hence, we shall not chase the price higher. If the price corrects again and successfully retests the $550 levels, traders can initiate long positions with a stop loss just below $550 levels. The first target on the upside is $765, which is 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from the high of $972 to the lows of $558.6. At current levels, the risk-reward is not in favor of the bulls, therefore we want to enter on dips when the risk is lower. After days of low volatility, Ripple is finally showing signs of action. It attempted to breakout of the downtrend line both yesterday and today, however, it could not close above our buy level of $0.2000. We, however, should maintain our buy on a close above $0.2000 because that will invalidate the bearish descending triangle pattern. A failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign.  The stop loss for the trade is well-defined at $0.1260, a level not touched since May 9 of this year. Traders can expect a rise to $0.2500 initially and thereafter to $0.3250 levels. However, this is a risky trade as we are buying in a downtrend, in anticipation of a change in trend. Therefore, please be careful and try keeping the allocation size small. Litecoin has been range bound between $35 on the lower end and $50 on the upper end since mid-June of this year. Though it broke out of the range on July 4, it could not sustain the rally and fell back into the range.  However, if the price again breaks out of $50 levels, we expect the uptrend to resume, which has a pattern target of $65. On the other hand, a breakdown below the trendline, can push the cryptocurrency back to the lower end of the channel. There is no trade within the range. Therefore, traders should initiate a trade only on a breakout above the overhead resistance of $50.

Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Jackson Hole Symposium is starting today. Though the equity markets are calm heading into the meeting of the central bankers, analysts will closely watch every statement of the US Fed chair Janet Yellen and the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. It will be interesting to note whether the cryptocurrencies also respond to their speeches. Let’s see what the important levels to watch are in case of a rally or a fall following the central banker’s rhetoric. Bitcoin is close to retesting the lifetime high at $4469. A breakout and close above this level will signal strength, and a rally towards the upper end of the channel at about $4630 levels is likely.  If the cryptocurrency breaks out of the channel, chances are that price will rise vertically, but the rally is unlikely to be sustained. Therefore, in case of a breakout above $4630, traders should trail their stops closely. The next target should be reaching the psychologically important level of $5000, which should act as a strong resistance. Traders who are long from lower levels should book partial profits and continue to hold their remaining positions with close stop losses, because there is always resistance at the previous lifetime highs. We don’t recommend initiating new positions at the current levels because the risk-reward is not attractive, as the logical stop loss is way deeper at about $3900 levels. Until the digital currency breaks down and closes below the channel, it remains in an uptrend. We had advised a stop loss of $280 to our readers who had gone long on our recommendation at $330 levels. As the price has moved above our buy levels, we want to further reduce our risk. We, now, recommend a stop loss of $290, below which the digital currency is likely to fall to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $247.  The cryptocurrency will pick up momentum once it breaks out of $345 levels. Its first target objective is $381, above which a move to $400 is also possible. However, traders are requested to raise their stops to $310 levels as soon as Ethereum breaks out of $345, and thereafter trail stops higher to protect their profits. We were correct to avoid chasing the price higher. According to our expectation, Bitcoin Cash has remained range bound. Though it doesn’t have a long history, after a sharp upmove from the lows of $190.1 on Aug. 06 to the intraday highs of $387.2 on Aug. 8, the cryptocurrency went into a correction/consolidation for the next eight days, before breaking out on Aug. 17.  The current leg of the correction is in its sixth day. We may see another two days of range bound action before the next move up or down. We don’t see any reliable buy setups on Bitcoin Cash, therefore, we are not recommending any new positions. However, aggressive traders can buy a successful retest of $550 levels or a breakout above $736 with close stop losses. Ripple scaled our first target objective and came close to our second target; however, it could not reach it. Therefore, traders should always trail their stops higher.  What can the traders expect now? In the present correction, the digital currency has found support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rise from $0.14749 to the highs of $0.29800. If it reverses direction and moves above $0.24000 levels, a rally to $0.28000 levels is likely. Therefore, aggressive traders can enter on a breakout above $0.24000 and keep a stop loss below $0.20100, because a breakdown below $0.20166 will be negative and the fall can extend to $0.17970. As the cryptocurrency is volatile, please keep the allocation size small. We had recommended a trade on a breakout above $50, as we were expecting a move to $65, however, Litecoin is currently facing resistance near the earlier highs. Traders who have initiated long positions on our advice should keep a stop loss of $46. We don’t want to hold the digital currency if it again falls back below $50 levels.  Nevertheless, as long as LTC sustains above the $50 levels, it signals strength and a move to $65 is likely.

Bitcoin’s dominance is down to 44.7 percent because, while the leader has been consolidating near the highs, altcoins have been playing catch up. However, let’s study the charts and see whether this trend is likely to continue or if is Bitcoin ready to surge once again. As expected, Bitcoin has been facing resistance at the lifetime highs. However, it has not given up its gains, which shows its underlying strength.There is a small resistance at $4630. Notwithstanding, the cryptocurrency is likely to breakout of it and rally to about $5000 levels, where it should face stiff resistance as it’s a major psychological barrier. Therefore, the stop loss should be trailed higher to lock in any gains. A note of caution. The RSI is showing the first signs of a negative divergence, which is a bearish development if confirmed by a fall in price. Therefore, traders should keep their allocation size small. A fall and close below the channel support and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) will invalidate our bullish view. Ethereum continues to rally towards our first target of $381, where it is likely to face dual resistance from the horizontal line and the rising wedge. Therefore, it might be a good idea to take partial profits close to $375 levels and hold the rest with a close stop loss. Though we expect the rally to stall for a short while at the overhead resistance, the trend will remain up as long as Ethereum remains above the trendline. However, if the bulls manage to push through the resistance, a retest of the lifetime highs is possible. Hence, traders should continue to hold their positions with appropriate stop losses. Nevertheless, we don’t advise fresh positions above $381, as the risk/reward ratio is not favorable. Bitcoin Cash is slowly drifting down towards a support level of $550. No long trades should be initiated as long as the digital currency is below the downtrend line. Though aggressive traders can buy the breakout and close above the downtrend line, please keep the allocation size small because it is likely to face resistance at $736. If the price breaks and closes below the critical support of $550, Bitcoin cash can fall to $440 levels. Therefore, no long positions should be taken at lower levels until a new buy setup forms. Though ripple broke above our buy levels of $0.24000, it never closed above it, which shows selling at higher levels. The downtrend line is acting as a stiff resistance. If traders have any long positions, they should be squared off below $0.19200 levels, because the digital currency will become negative below this level. Any fresh positions should now be initiated only on a close above the downtrend line. Please keep the allocation size small because this cryptocurrency is volatile. Litecoin almost touched our target objective of $65. Traders might want to take partial profits at these levels and hold the rest with a close stop loss of $58, because the cryptocurrency can rally to the upper end of the channel, which is around $70. However, Litecoin has a history of correcting after two or three large range bullish closes, therefore traders should be cautious at these levels. Traders who have closed their long positions at about $65 levels had better wait for a new buy setup to form.

151,2017-09-02 15:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Talks With People’s Bank of China Key to Chinese Blockchain Market,"  Cointelegraph   Advertise   Ripple investors are looking forward to the collaboration between Ripple and China tackling the country’s Blockchain market. Adoption Recently, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has visited Coinbase and Ripple on a US research delegation having talks about the “significant” cryptocurrency issue. Welcomed China's central bank, industry & academic leaders to #Ripple HQ to discuss the latest #blockchain trends https://t.co/jL3i4yYzjo As Bitcoin and Blockchain technology step into the more mass market adoption, many businesses are showing their interest to explore and penetrate cryptocurrency and blockchain platforms. Ripple investors are looking forward to the collaboration of Ripple and China tackling the country’s Blockchain market. Ripple is the creator and developer of the Ripple payment and exchange network. The company is based in San Francisco, California. ""Ripple"" is just the rename of Opencoin. The Ripple Blockchain focuses on banks, global payments, and digital exchange. China's has a huge network or connectivity when it comes to business and consumers. It is tempting for Ripple to get involved with the Chinese market because it will be a big hit to the company. China aims to widen its connection in the global trade market and the firm growth of China's existence across ecommerce will substantially require low transaction fees, cheap and fast flow of payment system. China is known to follow strict regulations and security when it comes to banking and financial transactions. In fact, recent warnings about unregulated ICOs caused certain companies catering mainly to Chinese investors to halt their operations. Ripple's business services revolve around bank-to-bank transfers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expects the company to enter consumer market in 5 years. Ripple has already confirmed the expansion of its business with China's Central bank. China is now researching on digital currency and the possibility of having its cryptocurrency. The fintech company and the China's Central Bank officials are having talks about the public Blockchain platform RCL or what they call Ripple Consensus Ledger. The delegation is to promote financial tech between China and the United States. Ripple had a presentation with the officials specifically on the nature of the public Blockchain, global payment ecosystem, and how they will benefit in applying the principle of Blockchain platform- its offer of low service fees, and fast pace of real-time transactions. Though there is no official announcement yet about the expanding business of China Central Bank and Ripple, people are looking forward to the great news and collaboration of the two entities ahead.

See the analytical overview to find out more about the prices.   The possibility of a war between the US and North Korea is threatening to derail the risk-on trade across asset classes. As a result, traders have been piling on safe havens like gold. Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies were also benefitting from this until China decided to crackdown on the “initial coin offerings” (ICOs). So, will cryptocurrencies buckle after the Chinese clampdown or will the fear of a war support the currencies in the short-term? Let’s study the charts to forecast the next move on the top five digital currencies. In our analysis on Aug. 29, we had predicted a rally to about $5,000 levels and had recommended to trail stop losses higher to lock in the gains, as we expected strong resistance there. Hopefully, our readers were not surprised when price corrected from the psychological barrier of $5,000. So, what should be the next course of action? Bitcoin continues to trade within the ascending channel. The correction from the highs of $4,980 broke below the trendline support intraday. However, the closing was well above it. Therefore, the uptrend in Bitcoin is intact. We shall change our bullish view only when the cryptocurrency breaks below the trendline and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). At the current levels, we expect a retest of the $5,000 levels. However, we are not sure whether the digital currency will breakout in a hurry. We, therefore, expect a range bound action for a few days. Aggressive traders can go long at the current levels with a stop loss below $4,400 and a target of $4,980. However, please keep the allocation size small, as we are seeing signs of a negative divergence on the RSI. Our analysis of Ethereum also played out according to our expectations. $381 acted as a strong resistance and price retreated from there. Comparatively, Ethereum is weaker than Bitcoin because it broke below the 20-day EMA and fell to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). However, it is also attempting to resume its rally following the sharp correction. As the price has broken out of the 20-day EMA, traders can buy at the current levels and keep a close stop loss at $318. A retest of $380 levels is likely. However, traders should keep a close watch at $354 levels, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $396.88 to $285. If price struggles to breakout at this level, consider closing the position and waiting for another setup to form. Please try to keep the allocation size small. Our bullish view will be invalidated if price breaks and closes below the ascending channel. Bitcoin Cash is presently trading in a descending channel. Both the moving averages have flattened out, which shows the possibility of range bound trading. If the digital currency breaks out of the channel, it can rally towards $736 levels. However, we don’t find any reliable buy setups. Therefore, we are not recommending a trade on it. Ripple never rallied the way we had expected it to. It has been volatile and direction less since breaking out of the descending triangle pattern. Nevertheless, it has not become completely bearish either, as it has not fallen below the 50-day SMA.  We don’t see any reliable buy setups, therefore we are not recommending any trade on it for swing traders. However, the digital currency can rally to $0.3000 levels if it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. Traders who attempt this trade should keep a stop loss below $0.1900. This is a risky trade, therefore, please think about keeping the allocation size only 25 percent of normal. Litecoin surpassed our target of $70 by a huge margin. $100 proved to be a strong barrier and price corrected to about 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rise from $41.65 to $98.28. Since then, the price has been in a pullback. However, we expect to see some kind of a consolidation for a few days before the digital currency again attempts to breakout of the $100 levels. Litecoin is likely to be volatile for the next few days. Therefore, we are not recommending a trade on it. The current situation is filled with uncertainty. Therefore, traders should reduce their allocation size considerably and adhere to their stop losses, as the digital currencies are likely to remain volatile for the next few days.

However, as we know, nothing can go up for ever. Gravity will catch up and there are bound to be corrections in between, which will offer a good entry point again. However, sometimes the corrections can be unnerving and can cause a large dent to the portfolio. So, has the time come to cash in some profits and be ready for a downturn or is this another of those consolidations that will breakout on the upside? Let’s see the charts and try to forecast. Buyers continue to support Bitcoin close to the trendline support of the ascending channel. However, bears are attempting to defend the $4695 level, which is a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from the high of $4980 to the swing low of $4234.16.  For the last three days, the digital currency has failed to breakout of the resistance. Notwithstanding, the range of the past two days has shrunk, which signals an imminent breakout or breakdown, either today or over the weekend. If the bulls manage to breakout of $4695, a retest of the highs is likely. On the other hand, if the bears breakdown and close below $4400 levels, the uptrend will be in danger. Therefore, traders who have gone long on our previous recommendation should continue to hold with a stop loss of $4400. They should raise their stops as the digital currency moves up. However, we continue to advise reducing allocation size to less than 50 percent of normal, as $5000 is likely to act as a strong resistance and a small correction or a range bound movement is not ruled out. Ethereum is struggling to breakout of the $341, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $396.88 to $285. Though the bulls have managed to keep the digital currency within the ascending channel, and they have not been able to breakout of the overhead resistance.  The RSI is close to the 52 level and the 20-day EMA has flattened out, indicating a range bound trading. However, if the bulls manage to breakout of $354 levels, a retest of $381 levels is likely. On the other hand, if the bears breakdown and close below the trendline support of the digital currency, a fall towards $285 is likely. Therefore, traders who have gone long on our recommendation should maintain the stop loss at $318. Bitcoin Cash broke out of the descending channel and rallied close to the overhead resistance of $736, according to our expectation. However, we did not recommend a trade because we didn’t find any reliable buy setup.  Currently, the digital currency is trading within an ascending channel. A breakdown from which will keep Bitcoin Cash range bound. The cryptocurrency will become positive only above $736. However, we still don’t find any reliable buy setups, therefore, we remain neutral on Bitcoin Cash. Ripple has again formed a small descending triangle, which is a bearish pattern. The pattern will complete only if the digital currency breaks down of $0.19300 levels.  However, if price breaks out of the triangle, it invalidates the bearish setup, forcing the bears to cover up, thereby pushing prices higher. Therefore, aggressive traders can go long at $0.2400 and keep a stop loss of $0.1900. The first target is $0.3000. Traders can expect ripple to gain momentum once it sustains above $0.3000 levels. Therefore, only half position should be liquidated at the resistance and the other half should be held with a suitable stop loss. The digital currency doesn’t have an established trend, therefore, please keep the allocation size small.   Litecoin is facing resistance close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $98.28 to $64. However, it has made higher lows for the past three days, which shows that the bears are losing their momentum.  Therefore, traders can enter long positions on a breakout above $83 and keep a stop loss of $73. The target objective is a retest of the highs. After a series of large range days, we expect some kind of a consolidation to set in. Therefore, presently, we don’t expect a breakout of $100 levels. Please keep the allocation size small.

After banning initial coin offerings last week, China is expected to ban trading of cryptocurrencies on domestic exchanges. This news has started a correction in the digital currencies. It’s not the first time that China has meddled with cryptocurrencies. The market had briefly corrected when the Chinese exchanges halted withdrawals of digital currency in February of this year, and followed it up with an extension of the suspension in March. However, digital currencies continued their march northwards after a brief hiatus. Will the same story repeat again? Let’s see what the charts forecast. Bitcoin moved opposite to our forecast, hitting our stop loss at $4400. The digital currency has broken below the ascending channel, thereby ending the upside momentum for the time being.So, has Bitcoin become negative? No, not yet.  It is currently in a correction that can extend to $3749 levels, which is a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rise from $1758.2 to $4980. The 50-day simple moving average support is at $3823. We expect Bitcoin to find some kind of support between these two levels. However, until the digital currency stops falling and forms a short-term bottom, we will not give any buy recommendations. We don’t find any bearish patterns either, therefore, we are not recommending any short trade on the cryptocurrency. Ethereum also went against our forecast and stopped us out at $318. The digital currency has also broken down of the ascending channel, ending its uptrend. Currently, Ethereum is taking support at the $285 levels, just below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rise from $130.26 to $396.88.  A breakdown below $285 can extend the fall to $263 where it has a strong support. If this support also breaks, the cryptocurrency can fall to $232 levels, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level. Though we see a downside opening up, the logical stop loss for the trade is at $310. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive, especially if Ethereum bounces from $263 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it. Bitcoin Cash is moving according to our expectation. It has become range bound between $523 and $736. A breakdown below $523 will find some support at $470, below which the cryptocurrency will become bearish and can fall to $440 and thereafter to $310 levels.  On the other hand, a bounce from the $523 levels will keep the digital currency range bound, with a possibility of a rally to $634 and thereafter to $736 levels. However, this is a very risky trade, especially when most of the top cryptocurrencies are correcting. Therefore, even traders who attempt this trade should allocate only 25 percent of their normal position size. Ripple has been trading inside a descending triangle, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $0.193 levels. The pattern target of such a break is way lower at $0.085. However, the digital currency has a strong support at $0.13500, which hasn’t been breached on a closing basis since early May of this year. We expect this level to hold.  On the other hand, if ripple breaks out of the downtrend line of the triangle, it will invalidate the bearish pattern and a move to $0.30000 is likely, with a small resistance at $0.26500. Aggressive traders can buy on a breakout and close above $0.23500 and keep a SL of $0.19000. However, ripple is not in a clear trend. Therefore, initiating any trade on it is risky. Traders who can quickly raise their stops and be disciplined should only attempt the trade. Please keep the position size small.   Litecoin did not reach our buy trigger level of $83, therefore, our trade did not execute. It is currently taking support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $42 to $98.  A breakdown below the $63 levels will be bearish for the digital currency, which can extend the fall to $54 and thereafter to $42 levels. Considering the bearish setup, we are not recommending any trade on it.

156,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Rebound? XRP Price Jumps to 7-Week High - CoinDesk,"Ripple's native XRP token jumped to a near seven-week high of $0.28 yesterday despite technical indicators that suggested the cryptocurrency's recent rally might be overdone. While a re-test of the August 31 high of $0.26 was on the cards, the rally was something of a surprise given that the broader market is under pressure. At press time, the ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is up 10.47 percent at $0.27. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 33.33 percent, while month-on-month, it's up 27 percent. Even so, XRP is well short of its record high of $0.39 set in May. As such, the present XRP rally could be a result of renewed interest among traders ahead of anticipated publicity for the company. If so, that makes the cryptocurrency vulnerable to ""profit taking"" following the conclusion of the event. As of now, however, XRP bulls have no reason to fear. Price action analysis indicates the cryptocurrency is all set for a rally to possibly record highs. 
  The daily chart shows: A ""rounding bottom"" is a saucer-shaped formation suggesting bearish-to-bullish trend change. In XRP's case, that means the pullback after the May high of $0.39 is over and the bulls have regained control. The overbought RSI indicates an extended move to the upside. The term ""overbought"" indicates a market that has advanced to a point at which, historically, it has tended to reverse and move lower.

159,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Old Flames, New Code: Ripple and Hyperledger Reunite for Interledger Effort - CoinDesk","Ripple and Hyperledger might soon get a chance to reignite an old flame. Following an early promise by Ripple to contribute code to the Hyperledger blockchain consortium's open-source repository, the two organizations parted ways over differing opinions on blockchain design. Whereas Hyperledger's members largely focused on private blockchains that required permission to join, Ripple instead created hybrid technology featuring a cryptocurrency more reminiscent of a public blockchain. But now, the star-crossed companies have found an unusual Cupid who may have what it takes to finally bring them together: NTT Data, a Japanese system integration company. The story begins with NTT Data (through its subsidiary Everis) working on a new version of Ripple's open-source Interledger protocol beginning in July 2016. The plan was to reimplement Interledger using the Java computing language, since Interledger is currently only available in JavaScript. 
 When Ripple learned of NTT Data's efforts to rebuild the platform, the company was not only intrigued, it wanted to help. Together, the companies have submitted the results of that collaboration to Hyperledger, of which NTT Data is a founding member. If admitted, the new Interledger implementation could mean not just a new language for developers to build with, but a bridge to connect all of Hyperledger's open-source codebases, including Fabric, Sawtooth and Burrow. In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas expressed enthusiasm about the effort, yet also relayed that there are final obstacles to be overcome to finally make things official with Hyperledger. Thomas said: ""We are supporting that effort, but there's still a lot of decisions to be made."" Described in a November 2015 white paper as a bridge between traditional banking ledgers, public blockchains and private blockchains, Interledger has evolved into a product capable of conducting a single transaction across as many as seven different ledgers. And with that, NTT Data increasingly saw it as a way to connect its clients to a diverse set of the ""world's existing payment networks,"" according to Everis blockchain program manager Isaac Arruebarrena. In interview with CoinDesk, Arruebarrena explained how NTT Data, which last year conducted $15.7 billion (17 trillion Japanese yen) in sales, grew from being a founding member of Hyperledger in 2015, to identifying Interledger as ""one of the cornerstones"" of its corporate strategy. ""Our main goal is to become the best technology partner for the companies we work with,"" said Arruebarrena, adding that, while there is a complicated history between Interledger and Hyperledger, he's dedicated to bringing the two together. He said: ""We are determined to contribute to the evolution of the Interledger protocol in order to enable interoperability between distributed ledger platforms and financial institutions' existing ledgers."" However, several steps must be accomplished before NTT Data moves Ripple's proposal into Hyperledger, according to the project's executive director, Brian Behlendorf. First is the formal selection of a name, which is currently the unwieldy ""Hyperledger Interledger-Java,"" taken from the platform's key distinguishing trait. But Hyperledger members are currently discussing how to make the platform's name more accessible, and possibly more easily trademarked. Alternatives include Hyperledger Connect, Hyperledger Liquid, Hyperledger QuILt (IL standing for Interledger) and Hyperledger Jill (a portmanteau of Java and Interledger). Outside the collaborative naming process, the technical steering committee is now evaluating the code and could accept or reject it as soon as next week, but likely no later than ""another few weeks,"" said Behlendorf. Once the code is approved, he said, the collaboration will begin the onboarding process as an incubating project, adding, ""and then the fun begins."" Behlendorf concluded: ""As Interledger appears to be a compelling way to build bridges across chains to transfer messages and assets, it's something I personally really hope to see accepted into Hyperledger.""

Ripple alleged in a complaint filed today in the Supreme Court of California that R3 failed to honor an agreement that included an option to purchase 5 billion XRP, the cryptocurrency of Ripple's distributed ledger network. According to Reuters, R3 asked the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the deal, which would have allowed it to buy the XRP at a price of $0.0085 per token before September 2019. Currently, XRP is currently trading at roughly $0.21 apiece, according to data from CoinMarketCap. A copy of R3's complaint was not available at press time. According to Ripple's complaint, R3 and Ripple allegedly struck a deal to create a joint commercial venture, which would have followed an earlier test, centered around XRP, that involved a number of banks involved with R3's consortium effort. 
 In the complaint, Ripple accused R3 of failing to uphold its end of the bargain as its fundraising efforts picked up steam, ultimately concluding with a $107 million funding round announced this spring. Ripple also accused R3 of hiding the fact that several of its consortium members, including Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander, among others, were looking to exit the group despite promises of advancing XRP to the banks involved. A spokesperson for Ripple told CoinDesk in a statement: ""Our filing is straightforward - R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP's ~4000% increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement. We wish them well as they continue to try and build their consulting practice. In the meantime, Ripple is focused on serving our ecosystem of nearly 100 customers and signing up more."" When reached, a representative for R3 declined to offer specifics on the case but struck an optimistic note about the firm's prospects in court. ""R3 does not discuss the details of pending litigation,"" the spokesman said. ""We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter."" The suit is a notable one, given that R3 and Ripple are two of the industry's best-funded startups and both focus their products primarily toward financial institutions. R3 and Ripple have raised $107 million and $96 million, respectively, in venture capital to date.

Announced today, Mojaloop is aimed at providing an interoperability layer between financial institutions, payment providers and other firms that offer such services to the poor and unbanked. Ripple's Interledger protocol, which is used to transact between different financial networks, is being used to help accomplish that goal. In addition to Ripple, three other financial technology firms participated in the development of the software. The app came out of the group's Level One Project, an umbrella initiative for its work with the unbanked poor that has seen it explore technologies like blockchain. The Gates Foundation has been weighing applications of the tech since as early as 2015, including its use as a way to bridge disconnected financial systems.

164,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Bernanke at Ripple Event: Blockchain Has 'Obvious' Benefits in Payments - CoinDesk,"Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is bullish on blockchain. Speaking at Ripple's Swell conference in Toronto today, being held the same week and in the same city as Sibos, the annual gathering hosted by Ripple's rival Swift, Bernanke told a room of several hundred attendees that he believes payments can be slow and expensive as designed using existing tools today. Bernanke, who led the U.S. central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, outlined the complicated process it would take for a bank in Germany to send a payment to a bank in the U.S., before saying: ""It's an obvious area where new technologies like blockchain or these electronic currencies can be used to improve the process."" 
 Bernanke, now a distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institute, called out Ripple by name, saying that he's read about the company's work and thinks that any effort in payments to reduce cost, improve accuracy, speed and reliability and ""bring the global economy closer together"" is a good thing. While the conversation mostly focused on monetary policy, Bernanke was asked to comment more on cryptocurrency and blockchain during the question-and-answer session, and his responses should come as no surprise as he gave bitcoin both muted praise and criticism as far back as 2015. Echoing those past statements, Bernanke said, ""bitcoin is meant to be an attempt to replace fiat currencies and evade government regulation and government intervention."" And that attempt, he contends, won't succeed because governments won't allow it. ""When bitcoin becomes a threat they'll take whatever action"" deemed necessary to quash it, he said. Unlike bitcoin, which works against regulators, he continued, blockchain businesses that collaborate with governments will likely see more momentum in terms of innovating on the payments system. Central banks around the world (including in Singapore, the U.K. and Europe) have taken more of an interest in blockchain technology recently, trying to figure out how it might create efficiencies within their systems. Case in point: earlier this month, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Jim Cunha said blockchain and other fintech startups would be pushing incumbent financial institutions and middlemen to be more innovative in their approach. When asked if bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and blockchain might affect monetary policy, Bernanke said he doesn't see that happening. Bernanke said: ""It could be a lack of imagination, but I don't think monetary policy has changed that much. [Central banks] are supportive of these new technologies because they'll improve the payment system ... but it won't affect the ability of the Fed to require a certain amount of reserves of affect interest rates.""

165,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Downplaying 'Digital Assets': Blockchain Reigns at Ripple's Swell Event - CoinDesk,"At Ripple's inaugural conference, it was all about the use case. On day one of its much-anticipated Swell event in Toronto yesterday, panels largely centered on the distributed ledger company's existing clients and proofs-of-concept. There, representatives from Banco Santander and Siam Commercial Bank talked about how Ripple - and its XRP cryptocurrency - has provided a beneficial rail for cross-border payments. Yet, the event was largely pessimistic about the value proposition of other cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin and ether). Not only did former Federal Reserve chairman Dr. Ben Bernanke (who led the U.S. central bank during the 2008 financial crisis) question whether bitcoin would be successful, but many of Swell's panelists made it clear that just by speaking about blockchain technology, they were not promoting bitcoin and other ""unregulated"" cryptocurrencies. 
 Cryptocurrency's ""promise was to replace credit cards and banks and that's been an abysmal failure,"" said Patrick Griffin, senior vice president of business development at Ripple. He told the audience: ""Retail payments is nowhere. Every company that went out to do that, they've all pivoted. No one has doubled down on the merchant acquirer business."" Instead, Griffin continued, XRP is the only enterprise-grade option for banks and other mature financial institutions. To be fair, XRP wasn't pumped quite so hard until the last panel discussion, when Griffin got on stage with Marwan Forzley, CEO and co-founder of cross-border business-to-business payments provider Veem, and Oliver T. Bussmann, founder and managing partner at Bussmann Advisory. Most of the day, though, was spent discussing the advantages of distributed ledgers (also Ripple) over the current labyrinthine financial system. Not only does distributed ledger technology grant faster, cheaper and more reliable payments, but Ripple's position in the ecosystem will allow it to scale, according to Ed Metzger, head of innovation at Banco Santander. ""Payment networks derive value from ubiquity. And the positioning of Ripple in that space is very attractive,"" Metzger said. If you don't have a network, then the technology doesn't have value in the future, he continued. Since the summer of 2012 when Ripple first launched, the company has partnered with more than 100 financial institutions who are now utilizing its global payments network. As such, many of Ripple's clients were at the event, some on panels explaining the benefits they observed during proofs-of-concept with the company's technology. For Banco Santander, its Ripple trial has demonstrated that it can answer customer pain points, like the significant time it takes international remittances to reach their destination and the significant fees that are extracted from those transactions. ""There are use cases where speed and certainty of the amount being delivered are important,"" Banco Santander's Bussmann said. He continued, saying that the real question in the UK and throughout Europe is how can institutions replicate the real-time domestic payment system there for international payments. In separate panels, Dr. Arak Sutivong of Siam Commerical Bank and Veem's Forzley agreed. Sutivong said: ""The use case [for us] is cross-border remittance from Japan to Thailand. Overseas workers' hard-earned money in cash [is] sent back home with unknowns. They expect the money to get there on time and in full."" And Ripple has helped Siam Commerical Bank accomplish that. According to Sutivong, the bank has been transacting with real money for some time, although in a controlled PoC watched by the country's central bank. On Sunday, during the Swell conference's pre-events, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also announced it's using technology developed by Ripple with its release of open-source software Majaloop, which looks to provide an interoperability layer between financial institutions that offer services to the poor and unbanked. But with that being the only news to come out of Swell so far, XRP investors were seemingly less than ecstatic, selling off the cryptocurrency to drop the price about four cents during the day's events. Twitter was equally mixed in its reception of the event. While many congratulated Ripple on securing key partnerships with the financial incumbents, others were unimpressed. According to Twitter user Nayt Breeze: ""Wasn't impressed by the news seemed like a meeting of speculation."" The commentary highlights just how contentious Ripple has become over the years, having launched as a bank-focused cryptocurrency play at a time when most cryptocurrency enthusiasts were very much anti-establishment. But Ripple's executives have only fanned that fire. During the panel, Griffin also said that while cryptocurrency has a role to play in back-office cash management, the uses won't be consumer-facing. And he says that's because the technology lacks know-your-customer (KYC) features required by financial institutions and governments. While that could be seen as a fine complaint, one that puts Ripple ahead when it comes to mature financial services, Griffin's other accusations were a bit harder to parse. For instance, he said bitcoin could never succeed if it took four hours to move money from one account to another (which doesn't seem to be the case on average), and contended ether transactions can sometimes take 15 minutes. But yet, Griffin could not be swayed even as an audience member asked what the panelists thought was causing the rally around bitcoin. ""The best I can explain is, with a hope-and-pray approach for cryptocurrency investors, that they're betting that digital assets will have a use case eventually,"" he said, adding: ""Bitcoin, question mark. Ethereum ... with machines paying machines, that feels very far away. But for Ripple, there are already funds locked up in nostro-vostro accounts that can use XRP to create efficiencies now."" Yet, it's interesting that Ripple would bring up nostro-vostro accounts (local currency-denominated accounts banks hold throughout the world), as the talking point was also on display at a rival conference across town. There at Sibos, also in Toronto, Swift announced its blockchain PoC focused on freeing up funds in those accounts was a success. In context, many see Ripple's decision to throw an event on the same days in the same city as Swift's big annual Sibos conference as a way to rouse its competitor. During the panels and presentations at Sibos, presenters seemingly went out of their way not to mention Ripple, the blockchain startup that's taken aim at Swift in recent years. The closest anyone came was when the CEO of Swift Gottfried Leibbrandt took a jab at Ripple while describing the financial incumbent's Global Payments Initiative. But at Swell, some of the panelists seemed unfazed by the head-butting, speaking broadly about blockchain's advantages to the financial system. According to Bussmann: ""It's all about real-time execution ... which will be a must-do in the future. [Banks] are going to have to go through a fundamental structural change.""

166,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,In 'Search' of a Swell? XRP Prices Rise and Fall Amid Ripple Event - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is on the decline at press time. And though it's a drop that's largely in line with bitcoin and the broader crypto asset class, there are conditions that perhaps make XRP worthy of exploration at present. For one, XRP has steadily gained altitude from its Sept. 15 low of $0.14, an uptrend that seems most likely to coincide with anticipation for big announcements at Swell, the conference the company launched on Oct. 16 to compete with rival Swift. A new (possibly annual) event designed to draw attention to its product suite, the conference spotlighted how Ripple is seeking to provide distributed ledger technology that could one day replace Swift, the organizer of the Sibos conference. 
 The result? Speculators who expected a boost from the visibility were likely not disappointed, though long-term holders might be. While during the conference, prices clocked a 7-week high of $0.30, the ripple-US dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is now trading at $0.22. At time of publication, the cryptocurrency has lost over 11 percent in the last 24 hours.  Stepping back, a look at the historical data adds evidence to the idea the Swell conference may have contributed to the boost. Google search results, for instance, show a strong correlation between search volumes and XRP price activity. Interestingly, search volumes for the term ""ripple price"" bottomed out in mid-September (around the time of its recent lows) and spiked ahead of the Swell event. The numbers point to close correlation between search volumes and ripple price activity. The chart shows:  Looking at the daily charts, the broader outlook remains constructive as suggested by the rounding bottom formation and repeated rebound from $0.15 levels.

As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.20 and has gained 10.34 percent in the last 24 hours. But while the gains are in line with action seen in most of the market, social media suggests XRP may be gaining on bullish statements. Making the rounds is one report by Palm Beach Research Group, which suggests the analyst expects the cryptocurrency to outperform in 2018. A closer look at the charts, however, indicates the rally today may have a more certain cause: Korean desks offering XRP/KRW pairs. Trading volumes on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, have gone up by 45 percent in the last 24 hours. 
 Volumes on exchanges offering XRP/BTC pairs have increased as well. That said, the volume pop was short lived as market attention shifted back to bitcoin. Still, the price action analysis in XRP favors the bulls.  The above chart shows: Binoculars image via Shutterstock

168,2018-02-15 14:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,American Express Opens First Blockchain Corridor With Ripple Tech - CoinDesk,"Back in 1927, pilot Charles Lindbergh could have flown cash across the Atlantic Ocean faster than most payments happen over that same body of water today. Whereas Lindbergh completed his historic solo flight from New York City to Paris in 33 hours and 30 minutes, a typical bank transaction today takes one to two days using Swift, and a typical ACH transaction can take twice as long. So, the news today that American Express has opened up a payments corridor using Ripple that can send money from England to the U.S. in just a few seconds has been a long time coming. A partnership with Spanish bank Santander, the new corridor is being positioned by Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, as an obviously faster, but also safer way to send payments across the Atlantic. 
 A former Swift board member, Treacher told CoinDesk: ""Whereas beforehand Amex had to send Swift messaging to the banks to request the payment to happen, now Amex is connected directly to the banks using Ripple and Ripple's cryptography, so that the movement of value happens immediately."" Run by American Express's foreign exchange international payments (FXIP) business, the corridor connects Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the UK using British pounds - all via Ripple's blockchain, RippleNet. According to Treacher, the integration routes non-card payments through the shared payment network for nearly instant, auditable cross-border payments. The project marks the latest development for Amex in a year that has seen the credit giant join the Hyperledger blockchain consortium and partner with the bitcoin app provider Abra. And for Ripple, which is coming off its recent Swell conference, the new work is another step toward letting its blockchain platform, tested throughout the first half of 2016, fly free. For example, Ripple recently connected Europe and the U.S. via its work with Swedish bank SEB, which late last year revealed its intentions to connect Stockholm with New York City using Ripple. Treacher said the SEB platform has already conducted $630 million-worth of transactions since it launched into production in Q2 of this year. While that project is advancing and is able to transact in nine seconds or less, according to Treacher, it is for now -- like the American Express project -- restricted to what he calls a ""pure"" blockchain that doesn't require a cryptocurrency. What both these projects have in common is ""a direct connection,"" he said. ""There's no intermediary cryptocurrency."" Going forward, however, Treacher expects that other banks will increasingly follow in the footsteps of financial services firm Cuallix, which last month became the first Ripple partner to convert cross-border fund transfers into the blockchain's native XRP token. Instead of holding dozens of what Treacher called ""exotic currencies"" in so-called nostro accounts around the world, Cuallix took the first step toward freeing up those funds otherwise trapped for new uses by holding the XRP itself. With Ripple's main competitor, Swift building its own blockchain using Hyperledger, and a rising tide of upstarts with their own variations on the cross-border payments use case, it's this use of Ripple's native cryptocurrency that Treacher thinks will elevate the company above the competition. ""Where these two come together is that as banks and users of banks, like American Express, adopt Ripple and start to connect up, XRP becomes an option they can use for liquidity purposes,"" he said, concluding: ""And that's where it really comes to life.""

169,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Makes a Splash: XRP Price Looks Up on Amex News - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is trading on the front foot again. Having hit a 4-week high of $0.27 at 14:00 UTC yesterday, the Ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is back to at $0.23 at press time - up 7 percent on the day, as per CoinMarketCap. And though the spike has faded somewhat, there are reasons to be optimistic about the cryptocurrency's price going forward. The strong bid tone in XRP may be associated with yesterday's revelation that American Express (Amex) and Santander have teamed up with Ripple for direct cross-border payments via the company's blockchain tech. 
 Though XRP itself is not being used, Ripple's blockchain network will help facilitate the near-immediate transfer of funds from Amex's corporate customers in the U.S. to businesses that bank with Santander UK. Ripple has also said it expects XRP to play more of a role in future partnerships. Comments made by Ripple's CEO yesterday to Bloomberg can't be hurting the price, either. ""It's only a matter of time before central banks adopt blockchain to settle high-value, interbank fund transfers,"" Brad Garlinghouse told the news source. But while the news flow looks supportive of prices, the charts also favor further upside in XRP.  The above chart shows: A rounding bottom is a long-term reversal pattern that indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. A move above the neckline is usually considered a confirmation of the bullish trend. ",https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-makes-a-splash-xrp-price-looks-up-on-amex-news/,0.7272727272727273,0.0,1,0
170,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,BitLicense Architect Ben Lawsky Joins Ripple Board - CoinDesk,"Ben Lawsky, the former New York Superintendent of Financial Services who spearheaded the BitLicense regulatory framework while in office, has joined startup Ripple's board of directors. According to a press release from Tuesday, Lawsky will help Ripple advance its payment platform as well as its in-house digital asset, XRP. ""The company and its leadership are passionate about making our global financial system more efficient, more secure and more fair,"" he said in a statement. Lawsky is perhaps best known for establishing the BitLicense framework, the notable and at-times controversial regulatory scheme that took shape in 2013 and 2014 and came into effect the following year. Since then, only a few licenses have actually been awarded, and a still-active legal effort aiming to undo the BitLicense remains ongoing. 
 And though a new consulting firm created in 2015 raised the prospects of Lawsky advising the industry he once sought to regulate, the former NYDFS chief has largely stayed on the sidelines. In a departure, however, Lawsky last month spoke about possible regulations for initial coin offerings (ICOs) at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, saying the potential for fraud could cause ""a backlash against the entire bitcoin and crypto ecosystem.""

Unveiled today, the platform - which will connect corporates between Singapore and India - will be accessible through Standard Chartered's Straight2Bank system. According to SC's release, the platform will allow users to see all fees up front, pre-validate transactions and thereby more quickly settle them. Reports in March indicated that multiple banks, including Standard Chartered, have plans to launch a similar system across several countries next year. Further, the bank was one of a number of institutions of its kind to take part in a $55 million Series B round in Ripple in 2016. Gautam Jain, who serves as managing director and global head of client access for Standard Chartered, said in a statement: 
 ""The successful launch of our commercial cross-border payment service marks a significant milestone in the financial industry's progress in applying distributed ledger technology for corporates.""

172,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Up 50%: Ripple's XRP Sets Price Record Amid Overstretched Rally - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is scaling new heights today, but the rally looks overbought, according to price chart analysis. XRP was last seen trading at a record high of $0.70 on data source CoinMarketCap, and has gained over 50 percent in the last 24 hours. Further, its market capitalization has jumped to $23.63 billion, making it the fourth largest cryptocurrency globally. The token's six-month-long consolidation in the $0.15-$0.13 range ended with an upside break on Dec. 12 - seemingly due to increased demand for alternative cryptocurrencies as bitcoin passed over its recent record peak and started to appear overdone. Possibly boosting sentiment for the network was the news earlier this week that banks in Japan and South Korea are set to test cross-border payments using Ripple-based systems. However, XRP itself is not being used in the trial. 
 South Korean markets, though, have certainly played a role in boosting XRP's price. A look at the individual markets on CoinMarketCap shows that trading volume on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in the country, has jumped 35 percent in the last 24 hours. Clearly, the rally has substance, but it looks to be overstretched, as per technical analysis.  The above chart shows: The strong bullish momentum could push prices higher to $0.7255 (361.8 percent Fibonacci extension). However, as noted, the rally looks to be overstretched, and there is some probability of a pullback to $0.50 (ascending trend line on 1-hour chart). Hot-air balloon image via Shutterstock

According to a Fortune report, sources said the addition of the new price data is aimed at forex traders seeking to explore the new instruments. They also suggested that Bloomberg terminal data for the new cryptocurrencies is being provided by Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp. Back in April 2014, Bloomberg opened up bitcoin prices to its Bloomberg Professional service, and in June of that year it was revealed that the data was being sourced from the itBit exchange. 
 The move comes amid sharp rises in the prices of many alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, along with the spike in bitcoin prices. Just yesterday, Ripple's XRP token surged to a new record close to 90 cents, while ether and litecoin have also both hit new highs in the past week.

174,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Price Passes Historic $1 Milestone - CoinDesk,"  The price of Ripple's XRP token has passed a dollar for the first time in its history. Currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, XRP passed the milestone just before press time, achieving an all-time high of $1.06, as per CoinMarketCap data. The rally in XRP follows months of sideways trading for the cryptocurrency, which took an upwards turn a week ago following positive news flow for banking-focused Ripple, as well as generally surging prices among alternative coins as investors look to move money out of an overstretched and falling bitcoin. 
 Most recently, the company announced in late November that Standard Chartered and Axis Bank are launching a new cross-border payments platform built on top of Ripple technology. Just a week earlier, American Express said it was using Ripple's network to connect Santander clients in Europe and the U.S. Today's price gains, though, appear to be largely driven by the markets, particularly in Asia. Looking at CoinMarketCap data, XRP has seen trading volumes increase over the last 24 hours by nearly 25 percent at major South Korean exchange Bithumb, while Hong Kong-based Bitfinex has seen volumes rise over 10 percent. At press time, XRP is trading at $1.05. The cryptocurrency has gained 36 percent in the last 24 hours and is up 74 percent week-on-week. Its market cap currently stands at $41 billion, also a new record high. ",https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-price-passes-historic-1-milestone/,0.8888888888888887,0.0,2,0
175,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Approaching $2 as XRP Price Doubles in Weekly Trading - CoinDesk,"A week after the value of Ripple's native XRP token topped $1 for the first time in history, the cryptocurrency surged again today, rising 34 percent. At press time, the token, used for transactions on the San Francisco startup's RippleNet cryptocurrency network, reached $1.87, a figure that was nearly double its listed price last week, data shows. The price rally arrived after a long period of inactivity in the market, which had held steady at $0.20 over the past six months. As a result, the market capitalization of XRP is now catching up with those of ethereum and bitcoin, according to data site CoinMarketCap. XRP is now the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with the value of its combined token supply now $72 billion. Data from CoinDesk indicates that much of today's price improvement comes from today's morning trading session (UTC 06:01 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.), where it recorded a 14.43 percent increase in the last six hours. 
 What's also notable is that global trading volume of XRP within 24 hours predominantly came from exchanges based in South Korea. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that three South Korean exchanges, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit account for 31.5, 7.3, and 2.07 percent of the worldwide XRP trading, respectively. In addition, within these exchanges, each has more than half of its trading activities concentrating on XRP, data also shows. The price rally also follows the South Korea government's newly issued policy that will ban cryptocurrency exchanges from allowing anonymous accounts, a move to curb market speculation in the country.

176,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple's XRP Token Sets All-Time Price High Above $3 - CoinDesk," Just two weeks after it surpassed $1 for the first time, the price of XRP, the token that powers San Francisco startup Ripple's open-source RippleNet network, has set a new all-time high of $3. According to data site CoinMarketCap, XRP has climbed more than 21% in the last 24 hours, hitting a price of $3 just after 17:00 UTC today. Ripple's rally comes after hitting a temporary low of $2 immediately following its previous all-time-high of $2.85 on Dec. 30, 2017, according to CoinMarketCap. Still, XRP is up 144 percent on the week, and more than 1,000 percent month over month. The cryptocurrency was trading at $0.26 just over 30 days ago. With the change, XRP is also bringing a shake-up to the leaderboard of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. 
 At press time, XRP has heavily increased its lead over ethereum, long the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. While just 24 hours ago Ripple had a $17 billion lead, that figure has now increased to $26 billion. Ripple passed ethereum in market cap less than a week ago, and has been holding the number three spot on Dec. 29, 2017. As Ripple has climbed, so too has the overall cryptocurrency market, with the total market cap surpassing $713 billion just a day after it climbed past $667 billion. On the day's trading, 15 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap are in the green, with ethereum classic, Qtum, EOS, iota and bitcoin offshoot litecoin being the notable exceptions.

177,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Fever? Other Crypto Assets Are Outpacing Its 2018 Gains - CoinDesk,"So-called alternative cryptocurrencies are making their presence felt in the first week of 2018, recording impressive gains that are drawing investors to options once considered risky. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rallied 1,900 percent last year. But, as prices neared the $20,000 mark in December, the relatively cheap ""small cap"" coins began to rise. With gains due, in part at least, to the rotation of money out of an overbought bitcoin, the broader cryptocurrency rally seems to have gathered pace in 2018. With 66 percent appreciation so far in 2018, Ripple's XRP token is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. That's impressive, yet XRP still ranks sixth on the list of top gainers so far this year, among those ranked in the top 25 by total value, as of 18:00 UTC. So which ""large-cap"" cryptocurrencies are leading the pack? 
  Overall, the TRON token tops the table with 270 percent gains since Jan. 1. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 100 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, and its market cap has tripled this week to $10 billion. In second place is the status network token (SNT) - an ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has gained more than 160 percent in value this year and is up 700 percent month-on-month. Stellar, which topped the list two days ago, has slipped to number three. It is now the seventh largest currency with a market cap of $9.97 billion. And although at a record high of over $1,000 today, ethereum's native token ether (up 28 percent this year) sits at the bottom of the table in 10th place. Interestingly, bitcoin ranks as low as 18 (up 2 percent this year), as prices have traded roughly sideways since the fall from its December all-time high.

178,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,$100 Billion Controversy: XRP's Surge Raises Hard Questions for Ripple - CoinDesk,"Ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is on a bull run. According to CoinDesk data, the price of XRP is up over 1,000 percent in just the last month alone, eclipsing $3.50 per coin Thursday after spending much of 2017 under $0.30. With a market capitalization above $120 billion, the token has usurped ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency after bitcoin, and social media is rife with speculation about when it might take first place. But where some might see the kind of meteoric growth that's often associated with a breakout product, industry insiders have been quick to tap the brakes. Rather than herald the run-up as a success story, some are using the spotlight to revive long-standing controversies that have dogged the Ripple blockchain network, the startup that created it and its fair-weather approach to marketing the cryptocurrency. 
 Indeed, founded with the mission to bring bitcoin's decentralized, cryptographic architecture to financial services, Ripple has had a complex relationship with XRP - at times touting it as a way for banks to transact seamlessly across borders, while at other points describing it as a benign value-add to enterprise versions of the company's software. Such hot-and-cold thinking has long been on display in the company's public remarks on the subject. As far back as 2012, for instance, the founder and former CEO of Ripple, Chris Larsen, spoke of the service as a bitcoin-like payment system. Only a couple years later, Larsen was de-emphasizing XRP's role, telling the Financial Times, ""The world is not going to adopt a new math-based currency."" Seemingly aligning with a rise in regulatory concerns over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, executives at Ripple even explained to Fortune in 2014 that its cryptocurrency is not meant to be a store of value or a medium of exchange. And there were times when Ripple leadership hesitated to call XRP a cryptocurrency at all. Asked directly about its use of terminology in 2016, Larsen pegged the decision to marketing, dismissing the term outright. ""It's not powerful,"" he said then. ""I think sometimes the word 'crypto,' branding-wise, is less institutional than 'digital asset.'"" Yet, as the term ""cryptocurrency"" has come back into fashion over the past year, that narrative has changed. In contrast to his predecessor, Brad Garlinghouse, who replaced Larsen as CEO when he stepped down at the beginning of 2017, has proclaimed the value of cryptocurrency, specifically XRP. And in interview with CoinDesk Thursday, Asheesh Birla, who's been the vice president of product at Ripple for five years, said he doesn't remember anyone at the company downplaying the necessity of digital assets. Rather, he said: ""What we did realize is that there is a pragmatic way of developing use cases that will use digital assets. I think that is a very pragmatic approach of building a payments solution. I think the patience, and the pragmatic nature that we're working towards is paying off."" And Birla has a point - three years ago digital assets were thinly traded compared to today, so it was hard to market XRP as a liquidity play. Yet the company's shift in tone, coupled with the XRP cryptocurrency's recent boom, has brought out a sea of critics who want to take Ripple to task for its seemingly opportunistic stance. However, they're being met by an equally strong force: a new group of crypto adopters who, all of a sudden, see XRP as an affordable way to get exposure to cryptocurrency and relieve their FOMO. Given the passionate support of its online fanbase, it's perhaps not a surprise that Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency has attracted interest, especially as new investors seek to diversify in the cryptocurrency market. For instance, Ripple evangelist and XRP bull Tiffany Hayden wondered in a tweet whether XRP could jump 740 percent to reach $20 a coin, and while that might seem a stretch, it sounds more plausible when considering that XRP gained 30,000 percent over 2017. Further, according to a tweet from Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, if XRP's price stayed around where it's at today and bitcoin's stayed around $15,000 a coin, by the time each of those network's cryptocurrency units (100 billion for XRP, 21 million for bitcoin) had been released, the XRP Ledger would have a network value greater than bitcoin's. Since bitcoin hit $20,000 this past December, a slew of cryptocurrencies have reached new all-time highs, some even outperforming bitcoin by leaps and bounds. But what sets XRP's activity apart may be the sheer volume of crypto enthusiasts who, seemingly, are working under cloudy impressions of the industry. In speaking with retail buyers, CoinDesk has found that, for some, XRP is their very first foray into cryptocurrency. In one conversation, a source, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that a friend had pushed him to buy XRP. This investor also cited other reasons for taking the plunge: ""Surely, because of the advantage of transferring funds very quickly and efficiently anywhere in the world; also its endorsement by [potentially] Amazon and Amex. It didn't hurt that it went from 20 cents to $1 rather quickly."" It's an interesting answer that sheds light on the state of the crypto industry as it moves into 2018. Bogged down - at least in the eyes of new investors - by a years-long technical debate, bitcoin seems to have lost its hold on the faster, more efficient payment method use case. In turn, cryptocurrencies that seem more mainstream (such as XRP in its proximity to Ripple) are looking more attractive to rookies. Yet, the partnerships Ripple has forged recently hide an inconvenient truth - that enterprises using Ripple's services aren't necessarily using XRP. And as such, XRP investors might not understand they're buying into a cryptocurrency very different from bitcoin and the others that have gained widespread attention over the years. Case in point: While XRP investors might be charmed by the thought of holding a cryptocurrency that one day a large swath of the banking system may use, the vast majority of Ripple's banking clients are using the company's xCurrent product - a glorified messaging platform. This product provides banks with real-time, bi-directional messaging with which they can track and manage cross-border payments, and is superior, Ripple executives say, to SWIFT's messaging platform, which only allows for one-way communication. So for instance, if an account number, name or some other data needed to send a payment gets mistyped when sending a SWIFT message, that message must go through its life cycle before the error can be corrected, with the receiving party sending back an error-and-cancellation message. The sending bank then has to go find where it messed up, and once the errors are corrected, a new transaction must be initiated. (However, SWIFT recently revealed a real-time gross settlement platform and is experimenting with blockchain technology to enhance its processes.) Ripple's platform, on the other hand, allows senders and receivers to communicate in real time, so simple errors can be fixed quickly, and transactions aren't canceled, but instead merely put on a momentary hold of sorts. Laid out to CoinDesk during the company's inaugural Swell conference in Toronto in October, Ripple's main product doesn't involve its XRP token at all. Onstage during the event, a number of banks using xCurrent asserted that they would not be using XRP anytime soon, contrary to what XRP investors might be banking on today. And xCurrent is the platform American Express is using. In mid-November, Amex announced that it had partnered with Ripple to connect Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the U.K. using British pounds. During the launch, Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, told CoinDesk that Amex and Santander were connected directly with no need for an intermediary cryptocurrency. Yet, the price of XRP rallied on that news, hitting a high, for the time, around $0.30 per coin. And now, with the price of XRP continuing its upward momentum, there seems to be another pump based on misperceptions about the Amex relationship and speculation that Amazon will accept XRP sometime this year  - both were mentioned by the anonymous neophyte as reasons he's investing in XRP. Secondly, many investors new to the cryptocurrency space might not be aware of where all the XRP actually exist. Unlike bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, XRP isn't created on a particular timeline through mining  - or the act of securing decentralized networks. Instead, the 100 billion XRPs (the cryptocurrency's coded limit) are already available, with most under the control of Ripple itself. Ripple currently controls about 61 billion XRP, although in May (where the price ranged from 5 cents to 41 cents) the company announced it would move to lock up 55 billion XRP is escrow, to be released at a rate of 1 billion a month for at least four and a half years. According to Birla, that lock-up started in December, and any XRP not used during the month is put back into the escrow accounts. In May, Garlinghouse told CoinDesk funds were being spent at a rate of 300 million per month, but Birla declined to disclose any updates to that number. Yet, Birla did say, with the price increase, the company would be re-evaluating what it needs. First and foremost, XRP's rise on old news and unconfirmed speculation displays one of the challenges within the crypto market - that there's no foolproof way to value cryptocurrencies. And not only that, but the definition of cryptocurrency is a bit murky as well. Because XRP's use is fixed to the Ripple Network, its protocol doesn't involve any mining and Ripple itself controls the majority of tokens, many long-time crypto enthusiasts would put XRP in a separate (albeit in some ways similar) bucket from bitcoin and other, more decentralized cryptocurrency projects. ""XRP will go down as the Icarus of cryptocurrency,"" tweeted Preston Byrne, an outspoken blockchain pundit, referencing a Greek mythological tale about hubris. In an interview, Byrne said he finds extremely troubling the trend of private companies issuing their own monies, retaining some for employee compensation and working capital, listing them on exchanges for speculation and then selling their monies on those exchanges to fund operations. Byrne, the founder of Tomram Consultancy and former general counsel of blockchain startup Monax, told CoinDesk: ""The scale of this activity has become distinctly market-distorting. My greatest fear is that these schemes could, if left unchecked, lead to a systemic crisis."" And chief among the criticisms leveled at Ripple is that the project is not truly decentralized, and so is little more than blockchain hype on a traditional system. The bitcoin developer and perennial blockchain skeptic Peter Todd has recently taken to tweeting a number of his concerns, and while they're all focused around the question of decentralization, his real uneasiness with Ripple revolves around the company's opaqueness. Ripple relies on a Unique Node List (UNL) - currently encompassing five core validators all run by Ripple - when matters of consensus need to be determined. According to Ripple, it cannot recommend any new validators to this list. In Todd's interpretation, Ripple has been slow to add new nodes to the UNL primarily because these validators must be trusted entities that stay in consensus with Ripple itself. And while a number of people and organizations run nodes on the Ripple network, according to Todd, choosing to route transactions through a node that's not a part of the UNL means that if your node comes to a different determination about the state of consensus than those nodes run by Ripple, it could split you off onto a separate ""Ripple"" chain. While Birla seemed to acknowledge the issue in conversation, he also said XRP Ledger (which was rebranded from Ripple Ledger last year) was decentralized in that it is open for anyone to use or build on top of. ""Anyone can download the XRP ledger package and become a validator and start broadcasting immediately, but getting everyone else to listen to you is a second point,"" Birla said. To address the paltry number of trusted nodes on the UNL (in comparison, bitcoin has about 10,000 validating nodes and ethereum has about 30,000), Ripple released a scaling roadmap which stated it intends to increase the number of trusted nodes on the UNL to 16 over the next 18 months. But according to Todd: ""The really dangerous thing here is Ripple's technical documentation doesn't make any of these risks clear - nowhere do they describe in detail how nodes can fall out of consensus with one another if their UNLs don't match."" Todd continued, saying that for Ripple's bank clients, being transparent about it's model as a centralized system that users can fully validate shouldn't be much of a problem.. ""For some customers that may even be seen as an advantage,"" Todd told CoinDesk. Yet, he alleges that Ripple muddies the waters because ""they don't want the market to lose confidence in XRP."" This much is clear: right now the market has a lot of confidence in it. Yet, while it seems people are rushing into XRP ahead of any real use of the cryptocurrency, Birla said that more companies will be announcing their use of XRP in the first quarter of 2018. Birla said he expects a ""full list"" of XRP users this year, telling CoinDesk about the xRapid product, which is basically xCurrent with XRP on top: ""There is a whole pipeline of folks now integrating into that product. We'll release names early this year."" He continued, saying the success of getting banks to use Ripple's non-cryptocurrency-related products is positioned as the first step of a bigger plan to move banks to XRP. And Ripple has had success in getting financial institutions to see the value in its xCurrent product. In total, since it started its ""war"" on SWIFT and the legacy financial system, more than 100 companies have joined its network. As far as XRP itself is concerned, though, only one company has publicly revealed its use of the cryptocurrency. In October, Mexican financial services firm Cuallix partnered with Ripple to convert cross-border fund transfers into XRP for easy delivery between currencies. When asked whether new XRP investors understand the relationships between Ripple, its clients and XRP, Birla said, ""Big names like Amex and smaller names, like other companies were signing, are all helping build out the network. We're adding on the liquidity [part] after that"" - that is, the xRapid product that uses XRP. He continued, ""We've been really clear. The way that we looked at solving problems was a very methodical approach, a pragmatic approach.""  According to him, XRP's use case couldn't be realized until Ripple had built out the network. ""We've identified a use case, we've identified a pain point, we have real customers using our product,"" Birla said, concluding: ""We have continued to get market traction. That has continued to get a lot of interest in Ripple and XRP in general.""

179,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Eyes Retreat After Record Price Highs - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP token may have found a short-term top and there's potential for a sustained pullback in prices, price charts suggest. As per data source OnChainFX, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market value is down 15 percent from a record high of $3.84 set yesterday. Over 24 hours, XRP is down 10 percent. A look at the top 10 ripple markets shows that the sharp retreat from the yesterday's high is mainly due to losses in the XRP/KRW (Ripple-Korean won) pair. Also, profit taking in XRP/BTC (Ripple-bitcoin) may have played a role in dragging down XRP. While the price action looks toppy, the technical charts indicate there is scope for a deeper pullback. As of writing, XRP is trading below $3.00 on western exchanges, while, in Asia, the price is still well above $3.50 levels. 
  The above chart (prices as per Bitstamp) shows:  The above chart shows bearish price RSI divergence (lower highs on the RSI) and falling tops as represented by the descending trendline on the price chart. Meanwhile, the rising trendline could offer support at $2.35 levels.  The topping pattern seen on the XRP/BTC chart adds credence to the bearish case put forward by XRP/USD (discussed above) and the rise in bitcoin seen today. The close today below BTC 0.00016276 (yesterday's doji candle low) would confirm a bearish doji reversal and could yield a pullback to sub-0.00010 BTC levels.

180,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Claims 3 Big Money Transfer Firms Will Use XRP in 2018 - CoinDesk,"Three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide will be implementing Ripple's XRP token in their payment flow systems this year, the company said in a tweet Thursday. The tweet, which did not identify the partners, comes as XRP has rallied to overtake ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap while Ripple has been criticized for its fairweather and sometimes opaque way of talking about the token. Part of the criticism stems from Ripple having scored more than 100 financial institutions to use its xCurrent product, a messaging platform that does not involve XRP, and many new investors mistaking that for XRP support by those institutions. Before Thursday, only one enterprise - Mexican financial services firm Cuallix - had announced its use of XRP for cross-border money transfers. 
 But the company tweet, and comments to CoinDesk from Asheesh Birla, vice president of product at Ripple, earlier this week, suggest that more will be added this year. In another tweet late Thursday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse responded to a New York Times article casting doubt over XRP's usage by sharing comments he said were from banks and payment providers who examined or tested the cryptocurrency. Referencing Ripple's xRapid product, which puts XRP on top of the company's xCurrent messaging platform, Garlinghouse wrote: ""Over the last few months, I've spoken with actual banks and payment providers. They are indeed planning to use xRapid (our XRP liquidity product) in a serious way."" Despite its recent run to nearly $4 per coin, XRP is down on the day, following a statement by Coinbase that it does not have plans, at this time, to list the cryptocurrency (or any other new ones) on either its flagship exchange or its GDAX platform.

181,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Down Not Out? Ripple Bulls May Regain Momentum - CoinDesk,"The 50 percent decline of Ripple's XRP token from the record highs may have strengthened the bears, but chart analysis indicates further downside may be limited. As per data source OnChainFX, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 16.85 percent in the last 24 hours. As of writing, XRP is trading at $1.88 levels. Part of the price drop from $3.36 to $2.07 witnessed on Monday can attributed to data provider CoinMarketCap's  unannounced decision to exclude three Korean exchanges, causing its global average to suddenly drop. The resulting selloff came to halt after the change in average calculation methodology became public, allowing for a partial recovery in the XRP price to $2.46. However, the relief was short-lived. XRP fell below $2.00 yesterday and hit a 12-day low of $1.71 today. 
 The decline in prices over the last 48 hours highlights the bearish undertone across the wider crypto markets. Stellar lumens has dropped by 15 percent over a 24 hour period; NEM and cardano are down 13 percent and 15 percent, respectively; while TRON has lost a hefty 24 percent in value. Fighting the trend, the top performer is ether (ETH), which hit a new all-time high of $1,417 today. ETH has gained around 11 percent over 24 hours.

According to a  press release, MoneyGram will test Ripple's xRapid service due to its claimed speed and cost efficiency. The release noted that XRP transaction fees are significantly less than those of the bitcoin network. While existing money transfer companies need to have pre-funded accounts in different nations to ensure they are able to facilitate transactions, using XRP means the company can directly transfer funds from one country to another instead, Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse said. Garlinghouse continued: 
 ""The inefficiencies of global payments don't just affect banks, they also affect institutions like MoneyGram. ... By using a digital asset like XRP that settles in three seconds or less, they can now move money as quickly as information."" The companies will also test Ripple's other products, including xVia, according to the release.

The two companies become the latest to sign onto the product, which uses the firm's XRP token, following news that remittance major MoneyGram was testing it for internal processes. Ripple had previously announced last October that Cuallix, a Mexican financial services firm, was using XRP. As indicated in statements, the aim is to improve the speed of payments to a point at which they are occurring in real time. In tandem with that goal, the companies are looking to the tech as a way to drop the overall cost of transacting. Alfredo O'Hagan, SVP of IDT's consumer payments business, said in a statement: 
 ""We're excited to pilot Ripple's xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost.""

Kidd, who will join Uphold's board of directors, will also help fund the creation of a research and development arm, to be called Uphold Labs, through his investment vehicle Hard Yaka. Kidd has previously invested in Coinbase, Square and Twitter. In a statement, the investor praised Uphold's scalability, as well as its compliance practices. In addition to forming Uphold Labs, the investment will help fill Uphold's loss assurance to roughly 20 percent of its crypto holdings, protecting its users from potential losses due to cryptocurrency volatility or other issues. 
 Kidd told CoinDesk: ""Because of the strength of Uphold's compliance and controls, I'm willing to pledge a certain amount of my balance sheet, or the balance sheet of my venture company ... as a reserve. That means that if there was some adverse effect at Uphold that might put it otherwise in a position of operating as a fractional reserve, this is like an insurance program that will make sure that user balances are protected."" A spokesperson for Uphold said the licensing revenue and development wing will receive 20 percent of the funding, which will be used to add more cryptocurrencies to increase the firm's connectivity to financial systems, as well as for use in Ripple-related projects. Then, 45 percent will go to equity, and the remaining 35 percent will be shifted to its reserve balance sheet. The partnership will help Uphold provide ""unprecedented asset protection,"" said chief executive Adrian Steckel. Formerly called Bitreserve, before its rebrand in 2015, Uphold offers foreign exchange and international remittances in bitcoin and fiat currencies. It also provides e-commerce services.

186,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,In Their Own Words: Real Companies Talk Ripple XRP Pilots - CoinDesk,"Just one - before this month, that's how many financial firms had publicly expressed interest in using Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP. Indeed, the blockchain startup has no lack of partners, from American Express to SEB, that use its xCurrent product, which allows financial institutions to send transactions in real-time without the innovative new crypto-asset. But it was only a little-known company (Mexico-based Cuallix) that had signed on to use Ripple's xRapid to leverage XRP for liquidity. Flash forward to today, however, and the narrative has seen a shift. In rapid-fire succession, three money transfer firms revealed they are piloting the use of XRP. First was remittance giant MoneyGram, then came Mercury FX (which conducts about $500 million in transaction volume per year) and finally telecom provider IDT. 
 To many, the news has been a vindication - not just for Ripple, but for the millions of mainstream investors that have embraced XRP as an alternative investment, helping it rise from mere cents early last year to nearly $4 this month. And while it's still an open question as to whether such tests will go live, during the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse framed the general skepticism as old-fashioned and out of touch. Garlinghouse told attendees: ""When I hear banks say, 'We're not going to use digital assets,' I hear Randal Stevens say 'AT&T will never use IP.'"" So far, the largest interested party in XRP is legacy money transmitter MoneyGram, which in addition to being valued at $700 million, has over 350,000 locations around the world at which customers can pick up cash. However, the pilot does not directly serve any of those locations, according to a spokeswoman. Instead, the pilot is focused on implementing XRP within Moneygram's internal corporate treasury transactions. In an email, she described an internal pilot for back-office functionality only. ""MoneyGram is not using XRP in customer transactions,"" the spokeswoman told CoinDesk. That might seem a bit strange, since a whopping 89 percent of Moneygram's revenue in 2016 was generated from its money transfer service, according to the company's most recent annual report, and XRP (and other cryptocurrencies) are widely targeted at cross-border money movement. But while those potential XRP use cases aren't being tested yet within MoneyGram, Holmes said what the company learns from the internal pilot could someday inform much broader applications. The spokeswoman said: ""The goal is to investigate whether it is efficient in terms of time and cost and to see if it can be a viable addition to our FX trading."" Perhaps more notably, London-based Mercury FX's interest in XRP is geared towards consumer-facing applications. ""I imagine we will be able to begin using XRP for customer payments in the coming months,"" the founder and director of Mercury FX, Alastair Constance, told CoinDesk. He continued, saying, ""As with all things, we will start with more modest sums in the thousands of dollars and increase by orders of magnitude from there. Come to the end of the pilot we will not be surprised if XRP is carrying single transactions across the blockchain of a million dollars or more."" By far the most detailed pilot, the Mercury FX project will use xRapid to conduct payments for goods and services in China and Mexico, with the hope that it will expand to other emerging markets via partnerships with Ripple and other platforms. While the software for the pilot is currently being integrated with Mercury FX, Constance said the pilot won't likely formally begin for two more months, before concluding about three months after that. Not all of Mercury FX's nearly $500 million in annual transaction volume will be conducted with XRP anytime soon, though, as Constance said he's also exploring using some of Ripple's other blockchain products that don't require XRP. ""Crypto is building into crypto from one side and fiat needs to build from the other side,"" he said. ""Ripple lets fiat companies like us do that."" While XRP dropped from its nearly $4 highs, it's held relatively stable between $1 and $1.50. Yet, it'll be interesting to see how news of new pilots and interest affect the price of the cryptocurrency, especially if new details about Cuallix's work and IDT's pilot are revealed. IDT declined to comment for this report, other than to point to its existing statements, where Alfredo O'Hagan, SVP of IDT's consumer payments business said, ""We're excited to pilot Ripple's xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost."" Cuallix did not respond to inquiries before press time. Of note also though, is another, newer use case for XRP - as venture capital. Last week, online marketplace Omni revealed it had accepted a venture investment largely in XRP, which it plans to use in part to pay the bills -- such as paying freelancers. With all these new projects implementing XRP into the plan, no one is possibly more relieved than Ripple executives themselves, who had known of the interest, but had largely been unable to share it with the public. Ripple's head of product, Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk: ""We're pleased to be able to share how payment providers are implementing xRapid to improve their payments flows. Remember, we just built and launched xRapid late last summer. This is just the beginning.""

Twin filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated Jan. 25 and 26 show that co-founders Tim Lewkow and Eli Lang are seeking funds to back Fractal Investments, which invests in crypto-assets, per its official website. The company dates back to last summer and has maintained a public profile primarily through its Twitter account. Lang is formerly creative director for Ripple, having begun working for the San Francisco-based startup in 2012. Lewkow worked for Ripple from December 2013 until June of last year, most recently serving as integration engineering manager, according to his LinkedIn account. The filings detail two vehicles, Fractal: Virtual Currency Investment Fund I LP and Fractal: Private Investment Fund LP, both of which are incorporated in Delaware. Neither filings indicate how much money is being raised for either entity. 
 The developments perhaps highlight the continued drive to establish hedge funds and other financial entities amidst a period of heightened activity in cryptocurrency markets and development around the tech more broadly. Like others, Fractal is looking to invest in the growing ecosystem of digitized assets. And even as traditional investors move to invest in the space, others are pushing even further.

The price of XRP fell to a two-week low of $0.99 today, according to CoinDesk's Ripple Price Index. The XRP/USD exchange has depreciated by 11.86 percent in the last two hours, indicates CoinMarketCap. As of writing, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $1.01. XRP was last seen this low on Jan. 17 when prices fell to $0.85. The recovery that ensued then ran out of steam in the $1.72 neighborhood on Jan. 18. Since then, XRP has been steadily losing altitude, creating lower highs (bearish prices) on the price chart despite big financial firms publicly expressing their interest in the blockchain startup's technology. 
 That said, XRP is not the only loser today. Except for ethereum's ether token, all top 20 currencies by market capitalization are trading in the red. Bitcoin has dropped by 8.69 percent in the last 24 hours. Cardano and Stellar are down 14 percent, while bitcoin cash has depreciated by 10 percent.

190,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Santander to Roll Out Ripple-Powered App in 4 Countries - CoinDesk,"Ripple has landed one of its largest clients yet, with Santander Group announcing a mobile app powered by the company's distributed ledger. The bank had been piloting the app for 18 months with its employees, integrating Apple Pay for payments between £10 and £10,000 ($14 and $14,000), according to Finextra. The app will be rolled out in Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Poland, according to the company's 2017 earnings presentation. Customers will be able to use the app to facilitate same-day cross-border payments in under a minute, according to the slide. The app will also provide a digital wallet, a personal finance manager and help aid person-to-person payments. A Santander spokesperson said the company plans to launch the app in the next few months, and that it will use Ripple's xCurrent in the project. 
 Ripple's xCurrent product does not use XRP, the company's native cryptocurrency. Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse announced the move to his followers on Twitter, noting that the app will be released this quarter. Separately, Ripple spent about $84 million of XRP from its nearly $1 billion January reserve last month, according to current market prices. The company had access to 1 billion XRP last month, meaning the remaining 900 million went back into escrow at the end of January. The funds were transferred back through two transactions, with the 900 million XRP holding a value of $756 million at press time. The company has 61 billion XRP valued at $51 billion locked up in escrow over the next four years through a series of smart contracts. Ripple's escrow movement was developed as a way to increase trust in XRP. Due to Ripple's own holdings, limiting access to the tokens from even the developers prevented massive token dumps which could tank the price. Each month, 1 billion XRP is released to the company for internal use. While in the past, Ripple used on average some 300 million XRP per month, it appears to be requiring fewer of its reserve tokens, at least according to this one data point.

191,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple's XRP Worst Hit By January Market Decline - CoinDesk,"Large-cap cryptocurrencies may have had a stellar 2017, but 2018 hasn't been so kind. Among crypto assets with over $1 billion in invested value, Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency may have been the biggest disappointment to newer investors, declining sharply amid heightened scrutiny after a period in which it became an industry darling for new investors. Still, XRP was far from alone in its sizable declines. Bitcoin forks saw a similar sell-off, with bitcoin cash (BCH), which forked from the network in August, and bitcoin gold, which quickly followed, falling sharply amid a broad market decline. 
  Entering January, it's safe to say investors were high on XRP. A key product for one of the most well-known industry startups, the digital asset won no shortage of favor from investors enamored by its goal of disrupting an oligopolistic global payments industry. And the company provided fresh reasons for the interest. By the time XRP had become the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide were said to be in the process of implementing XRP in their payment flow systems. However, as the month progressed, the optimism failed to keep XRP bid. A rumored listing on Coinbase never happened, and this, coupled with a broader market weakness weighed heavily over XRP. As of now, XRP is changing hands at $0.89 - a figure that's down almost 80 percent from its record high.  Bitcoin cash (BCH), a fork of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, soared in the fourth quarter of 2017, as investors took note of the faster transaction speed and low fees. Not only that, its surprise listing on Coinbase's GDAX exchange in December boosted its appeal, while cryptocurrency exchange CoinEx implemented bitcoin cash as its default currency in January. Still, it wasn't all green for BCH, as it dropped 41.29 percent last month, possibly due to fears of stricter regulations in South Korea and China, the latter region being one from which it draws the majority of its support. As of writing, BCH is trading at $1,169, down around 72 percent from its all-time high.  Created via a fork of bitcoin in mid-November, bitcoin gold (BTG) surged to record highs in 2017. Still, despite the temporary highs, in its initial days, it was perhaps the most unloved of bitcoin's many forks. Back then, the investor community felt BTG was overvalued with few (or no) apparent use cases. Entering January, it seems that sentiment won out, as BTG was one of the worst performers in January amid broad market sell-off. As of writing, BTG is trading at $108, down 78 percent from lifetime high.

""The early adoption of this game-changing technology allows us to offer a competitive service, as it will have an impact on the speed and cost of cross-border transactions,"" Promoth Manghat, the company's chief executive, was quoted as saying by Business Insider. 
 The company will not use Ripple's XRP token as part of its deal. Instead, the exchange will use Ripple's broader technology stack for executing transactions. The UAE Exchange marks the latest firm to sign on with Ripple, which has announced partnerships with firms like LianLian, Santander UK, IDT Corporation, Mercury FX and MoneyGram in recent days. LianLian is also using RippleNet, while Santander UK is utilizing xCurrent, another Ripple product. Mercury FX, IDT Corporation and MoneyGram are all trialing Ripple's xRapid product, which makes use of the company's XRP token.

194,2018-02-15 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Saudi Central Bank to Test Ripple Payments Tech - CoinDesk,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple has struck a deal with Saudi Arabia's central bank on a pilot program that will see banks in the country trial the company's tech. Announced today, the pilot with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority marks the second central bank to work with the startup, coming after the Bank of England, the U.K.'s central bank, began working with Ripple last year. Word of the latest deal first emerged earlier this week following comments from CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the Blockchain Connect Conference in San Francisco. ""This ground-breaking pilot program is the first of its kind to be launched by a central bank. Participating banks from the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] will use xCurrent to instantly settle payments sent into and out of the country, with greater transparency and lower costs,"" Ripple said. That the banks in Saudi Arabia would look to pilot xCurrent is perhaps unsurprising given recent interest in the Ripple product by other notable financial institutions. Earlier this month, CoinDesk reported that Santander is in the process of rolling out a mobile payments app that uses the xCurrent tech (which does not rely on Ripple's XRP token), with Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Poland serving as the initial markets for that release. 
 The announcement also comes a day after news emerged that UAE Exchange, a major remittance company in the United Arab Emirates, had signed on to use the startup's RippleNet product to manage cross-border payments. Separate from the Saudi Arabia news are reports about tests being conducted by remittance giant Western Union, which confirmed in an earnings call yesterday that it is piloting the startup's tech. Fortune reported today that, per a spokesperson, the company is testing payments using XRP. ""We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,"" Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. ""And we do test, we do have some tests with Ripple."" Ripple said as far back as 2015 that it was working with Western Union, though the remittance company didn't comment at the time.

According to the San Francisco startup, its licensed subsidiary sold $31 million worth of XRP during Q2 2017. The figure was up threefold from Q1, when it recorded $6.7 million in sales. According to the report, $21 million in such purchases came from institutional investors who actively approached the company through Ripple's licensed money service business. The company sold an additional $10.3 million XRP in a more passive way through sales of the asset to fund its operations. On public exchanges, Ripple also noted an increasing volume of fiat-for-XRP purchases during the same period, again suggesting an increasingly more mainstream audience. 
 While bitcoin contributed to 85% of total exchange-traded XRP volume in Q1, this number dropped to 63% by the end of June, according to the company. As of press time, XRP is trading at $0.17, down from $0.40 on May 17, its most recent all-time high.

In new statements to CoinDesk, the San Francisco blockchain startup aimed to address rumors that first appeared last Thursday on XRP Chat, a forum dedicated to gossip and commentary on both the company and its technology. In short - yes, the blockchain company is planning to set up operations in China, but no, it's not doing so with the help of one of the region's e-commerce giants. Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple's director of joint venture partnership, told CoinDesk: 
 ""China is a key market for a global payments network, which is why we are looking to build a presence there. Total cross-border [business-to-business] payment value involving China is $5 trillion annually, and the large Chinese e-commerce market currently lacks a highly efficient and low-cost solution."" Most recently, Ripple added 10 new financial institutions to its blockchain network, including MUFG in Japan, BBVA in Spain and SEB in Sweden, but membership by Chinese firms has so far been absent. And it appears it will have to keep working on adding a big name from China to that impressive list of collaborators. Ripple also put to rest speculation that Alibaba was already running a validator node on the Ripple network. Images in the post showed a node that appeared to be operating in Hangzhou, China, with an address linking it to Alibaba Advertising Co., Ltd. This led some to believe the Chinese mammoth would help Ripple maneuver its way into the country, though a Ripple spokesperson said such an effort is not in the works: ""Alibaba (the company) is not running a validator.""

197,2018-02-16 15:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Lightning Bank Ledgers? Bitfury and Ripple Demo New Twist on Bitcoin Tech - CoinDesk,"Bitcoin's much-anticipated Lightning Network is now compatible with seven different payment networks. Today, blockchain services firm Bitfury and payments network provider Ripple are releasing new code that makes it possible to conduct Lightning-style transactions across a range of both blockchain and legacy payment networks. While still in its early stages of deployment, it's believed the Lightning Network could one day expand bitcoin's capacity to millions of transactions by moving those transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain. However, today's news arguably goes a step further, adding weight to the idea that the top-layer payments network isn't just a tool for bitcoin. The two companies released a demo showcasing how the new technology can be used to make a transaction between bitcoin and litecoin, the two blockchain networks which have arguably made the most progress in developing the Lightning Network. 
 Since Lightning is increasingly perceived as a necessary layer for blockchain transactions, the companies view this as a big step toward a future where users won't have to worry about which payment method they're using. Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas told CoinDesk: ""I shouldn't have to care which particular coin you use or like. If you're on PayPal and I'm on Alipay or if I'm on bitcoin and you're using a bank account, I'll still be able to send you money and not worry about it. That's the long-term goal."" Honing in on Ripple and Bitfury's work more specifically, the companies have released code that integrates the Lightning Network with Interledger, a protocol designed by Ripple for making transactions between different types of blockchains. This means it's compatible not only with public blockchains like bitcoin or ethereum, but with permissioned protocols managed by only a few companies, as well as traditional payment methods such as PayPal. Interledger aims to support transactions between all of these services by offering a type of ""payment-agnostic"" escrow service. The W3C initiative made its first successful transaction across these various types of payment methods earlier this summer, but the new part here is that the Lightning Network can now sit on top of this infrastructure. ""Lightning natively supports transactions across different blockchains, but it cannot make transactions to any central ledger or to PayPal. That's why integration of Interledger is very, very useful for Lightning,"" said Bitfury researcher Viacheslav Zhygulin. Because litecoin and bitcoin already support test versions of the Lightning Network, the group successfully tested transactions using the LND Lightning Network implementation from Lightning Labs. (And, you can try it out using the open-source software, too.) Right now, it only works on the ""testnet,"" a sandbox version of the blockchain used to trial new features and applications, but Thomas said that the functionality will work similarly on mainnet (the live bitcoin network) once it's safe to deploy it there. In the process of developing the product, the two companies also developed a different testnet - what Thomas called a ""permanent testnet for testnets"" - that cuts across different blockchains as well. Still, while the technology has now been released, there's work to be done to make the technology usable. For example, there are currently no Lightning Network implementations deployed on top of permissioned blockchains that could take advantage of this newfound interoperability. Bitfury representatives argued, though, that the framework sets up the necessary infrastructure for the future. Additionally, Thomas noted that future success of the protocol depends on how many clients ultimately choose to adopt Interledger and Lightning Network technology. Still, the two companies described it as a big step towards moving money across different types of payment networks. And, since bitcoin and litecoin have near-completed Lightning Networks to work on the mainnet, it might not be long before users make real transactions between the two. Longer-term, Thomas indicated that the goal is to move beyond the payment networks that Interledger currently supports to encompass perhaps all of them. He concluded: ""After being involved in the community for so long, I've found that the missing ingredient - the one thing that's missing - is interoperability. Not just with the blockchain, but with central ledgers and more generally interoperability in the financial system.""

198,2018-02-15 14:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Hints and Rumors? How Ripple Might Really Enter China's Market - CoinDesk,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers. In this opinion piece, Acheson discusses one of the industry's best-funded startups, Ripple, and how it might seek to enter the Chinese market. When word started circulating last week that Alibaba might be running a Ripple validator node, a key question emerged - could this be the blockchain company's road into China? The answer, it seems, is both yes and no. While Ripple denied the rumors, it did confirm that it was looking to break into the Chinese market. 
 On the surface, neither statement is surprising. Of course, Ripple wants to break into China. Any fintech-related business would, given its massive size and high connectivity. And if Alibaba (or, more likely, a division) were running a node, it would make sense to keep quiet about it to avoid a speculative frenzy that would push up the price of the token, which could in turn affect the terms of any deal. The thing is, just because Alibaba isn't running a node, doesn't mean that the companies aren't talking. In fact, a partnership between Ripple and Alibaba makes a lot of sense - and not just for the two companies that would be involved. For Ripple, a San Francisco-based startup that has raised nearly $100 million to disrupt global messaging consortium Swift, the target is tempting. As China's push into global trade intensifies, so do the pain points for cross-border payments, including capital controls, fast-changing regulation and relatively high costs. What's more, the strong growth of China's cross border e-commerce - now at almost 20% of total foreign trade - further fuels demand for cheap and fast currency flows. Forging a relationship with any of China's large banks, however, will be tricky, given the heavy influence of the state and its reluctance to involve foreigners in its financial system. An affiliation with one of the internet giants, with their technology-first focus and their access to a sizeable user base, would be a much more efficient entry into the market. Yet, while the large internet companies have their own financial arms (and could be considered banks), their businesses are largely consumer-facing, while Ripple's operations revolve around bank-to-bank transfers. However, CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently said that he expected Ripple to break into the consumer market within five years. Where better than the largest consumer market in the world? A partnership to explore more efficient clearing in one division could be just the tip of the iceberg. Given Alibaba's sprawling structure and global ambition, blockchain technology has potential applications in many areas of its business, and in-depth work is already going on. Of all the conglomerate's businesses, however, it is perhaps affiliate Ant Financial that offers the most obvious short-term opportunity for Ripple. In a recent interview, its CEO confirmed that it is looking into blockchain technology to underpin Alipay, which dominates China's $5.5 trillion mobile payments sector. Another potential focus of collaboration could be Alibaba's electronic global trading platform, announced last year. Starting with Malaysia, the aim is to forge a network of bilateral links between China and sovereign trading partners, facilitating logistics, negotiating favorable tariffs and (take note) providing a platform for cross-currency electronic payments. But, other parties could also emerge as champions of such a deal. For example, moves by the Chinese regulators reveal an urgent need for transparency. Last week, the People's Bank of China mandated that all third-party mobile payments be cleared through a central platform by next June, to allow greater access to payment data and to keep an eye out for illicit movements. This trend is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future - on the contrary. It does, however, add layers of cost that a blockchain platform could mitigate. Ripple's solution could offer a means of settlement that bypassed central clearing, while still allowing the regulators to monitor flows. Given the obvious strategic benefit, it is likely that the main parties involved are at least talking. Whether cultural, economic and technological barriers can be overcome, however, is another matter. Should exploration go ahead, it would be a big step forward in blockchain development globally. It would also boost cross-border transactions... and relationships. ",https://www.coindesk.com/hints-rumors-ripple-might-really-enter-china/,0.3323308270676692,-0.006015037593984962,0,0

On the same day, in the same city as Swift's flagship event Sibos, Ripple has announced it will host Swell, an event also aimed at bringing the world's financial leaders together to network and discuss trends and strategies. But while similar attempts might fall short for some startups, what could set Ripple's event apart is its stakeholder buy-in. Keynoting the three-day conference in October is none other than the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, Ben Bernanke, and the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee.

 Ripple vice president of marketing Monica Long said Ripple still intends to be a sponsor of Sibos, and will continue to host a vendor booth there, but that the startup's aspirations were bigger than the vendor platform. Long said: ""Our vision for what we could do as an exhibitor exceeded what we could do on the floor at Sibos. The ideas that we had in mind around programming, you can't accomplish that on a show floor in a booth."" Prior to speaking at Swell, Bernanke was among blockchain's early supporters, writing in 2013 that the technology behind cryptocurrencies might hold ""long-term promise."" Likewise, Berners-Lee has long been rumored to be exploring the technology. Other Swell speakers listed as confirmed include the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, the managing director of GE Capital's treasury operations, Kristen Michaud and the head of innovation at Banco Santander, Ed Metzger. To be held in Toronto, Canada, Swell will take place from October 16 to October 18. While this year's Swell won't provide vendor-booth opportunities similar to Sibos, Long said that could change.

Also Read: Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Considers Bitcoin At end of day May 14, Ripple’s market capitalization was at about $8,345,000,000. Ripple continued surging well into the next day at about $11,500,000,000, continuing to climb. This has occurred in an oscillating fashion over the last few weeks, as Ethereum and the blockchain transfer token duke it out for supremacy.  Several news sites and other sources suggest this upswing in market capitalization was spurred by recent partnerships in the ripple network. These partnerships include large banking conglomerates and other banking organizations opting to work with or adopt the Ripple network. An April 26 Ripple press announcement said, Ripple is proud to announce the addition of 10 new customers to our growing global network. These financial institutions include MUFG, BBVA, SEB, Akbank, Axis Bank, YES BANK, SBI Remit, Cambridge Global Payments, Star One Credit Union and eZforex.com, representing some of the world’s largest banks, innovative smaller banks, and payment service providers (PSPs). Even though Ripple is gaining ground on market capitalization, there are distinctions between Ripple tokens and currencies like bitcoin and Ethereum. For instance, Ripple has enjoyed its market capitalization skyrocket as a result of gaining the aforesaid partnerships. This happened because Ripple is a “bank coin.” Several commentators pointed out ripple is not a decentralized cryptocurrency. It is a centralized bank-to-bank transfer coin. Ripple’s own commentary from their labs suggested the same when they mentioned being able to use a global freeze feature. “The freeze protocol extension gives gateways the ability to 1) globally freeze all their issued funds, or 2) freeze funds issued to a particular user. Frozen funds may only be sent back to the gateway who issued them.” This ability to freeze funds means that Ripple is not a decentralized blockchain protocol, but instead a distributed database that maintains control of the network from a central hub. This is a feature that would be impossible to execute if the coin was founded on decentralized algorithms. This comes to no surprise to many, though, because this fact is not a hidden agenda. Ripple’s website explained the purpose of their technology: Its purpose is to be an inter-bank transfer protocol to smooth out the financial interactions between banks. In this regard, Ripple’s market cap has increased as a result of their partnerships. These alliances caused the market capitalization to swell beyond Ethereum, even though Ripple is not in the same category of coin. It happened as a result of their positioning in the market. It happened because of a business alliance. By definition and design, Ripple is not meant to be a cryptocurrency. It is a “database coin” that is controlled via centralization and economic engineers. Will Ripple’s token continue to grow on into the future? Can it maintain the second position in terms of market capitalization? Let us know in the comments below.

The suit is in relation to Ripple’s attempted termination of a 2016 options contract that grants R3 the right to purchase up to 5 billion XRP tokens at $0.0085 USD each until September 2019. Also Read: New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode With Stefan Thomas of Ripple Labs  Ripple Labs and R3 Holdco LLC agreed upon the deal in September 2016, which was formalized through the issuance of an options contract to R3. The lawsuit alleges that Brad Garlinghouse, Chief Executive of Ripple, sought to terminate the options contract via an email which was sent to R3’s Chief Executive, David Rutter. R3 has sued Ripple in response to the email, arguing that the contract cannot be unilaterally terminated. R3 is asking the court to rule that R3 is entitled to all rights outlined in the 2016 contract. With XRP tokens now trading for more than $0.20 each, the contract would entitle R3 to purchase tokens from Ripple Labs before immediately selling them for an approximate gain of over 2000%.  Ripple counter-sued R3 in San Francisco, alleging that R3 had failed to deliver on a different partnership agreed upon by both companies that would give Ripple access to R3’s consortium of financial institutions in exchange for 15% of any revenue generated by Ripple through commercial partnership with banks associated with R3. Ripple’s suit also alleges that R3 touted major institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who exited R3’s network shortly after the establishment of the deal Ripple has requested that court declare to be invalid, and to mandate that R3 pay damages to Ripple. A representative of Ripple labs has stated that the company’s “filing is straightforward – R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP’s ~4000 percent increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement.” R3 has stated that it “does not discuss the details of pending litigation.

The pair expressed concerns that although many “high-quality projects” are using ICOs as a fundraising vehicle, numerous “copycat projects” have raised money without “intend[ing] to deliver any value to the people buying the tokens.” Also Read: China’s Central Television Warns of the Risks of Cryptocurrency OTC Trade Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, expressed his belief that “a lot of what’s happening in the ICO market is actually fraud,” also mentioning the increasing number of ICOs facing litigation. Although concerned by the actions of many token sales, Garlinghouse expects that said fraudulent activity will “stop” once regulators catch up with the industry. Garlinghouse also asserted that token issuers currently operate in a legal “gray area,” whilst they wait for regulators to catch up with the industry. The Ripple CEO suggested that the futures markets may prove to be analogous – as it took significant time to develop a regulatory framework for the futures markets. “There are a lot of really fabulous things that get done with digital assets and blockchain technologies to reduce friction, to reduce costs, and enable things that weren’t possible before. I think instead of focusing on those, we’re distracted by what’s going on in this gray area.” Joseph Lubin stated that although ICOs are being conducted by many “high-quality projects, …there have been a lot of copycat projects where people copy all the same materials (and) don’t intend to deliver any value to the people buying the tokens.” Mr. Lubin asserts that many of the said “copycat projects” were based in China, leading him to support China’s decision to ban token sales within its borders. “With China’s political approach to things, and with the fraud that was rampant there, it made a lot of sense for them to pause things a little bit and get a better, deeper understanding of the ecosystem, and scare potential fraud perpetrators,” Lubin said.

This milestone makes Ripple the first cryptocurrency other than bitcoin to break into the 12-figure threshold, and positions it as the second largest crypto by total market capitalization.  Also Read: Markets Update: Bitcoin Markets Retrace to the $15,000 Area The value of XRP has skyrocketed this month, surging from less than $0.25 USD on the 1st of December to set an all-time high of roughly $2.50 earlier today on Bitfinex. The price spike has witnessed Ripple come to comprise the second largest cryptocurrency by total market capitalization, with XRP becoming the first altcoin to exceed a total market cap of $100 billion USD. As of this writing, XRP is trading for approximately $2.35.  XRP broke above its preceding all-time high of approximately $0.40 on the 13th of December – at the time comprising a gain of roughly 100% since the 8th of December. Following the establishment of a new record price high, the XRP markets continued to surge, producing further gains of more than 500% in less than three weeks. Looking at a daily chart, the last two weeks of trade has produced volume divergence despite the price continuing to gain hundreds of percent – suggesting that the establishment of a local top may be coming soon in the XRP markets.  On the 7th of December, Ripple announced that it had successfully locked up 55 billion XRP via a “cryptographically secured escrow account”. Ripple originally published its intention to conduct the lockup in May, stating that “By securing the lion’s share of our XRP, investors can now mathematically verify the maximum supply of XRP that can enter the market.” The lockup was conducted using the “escrow feature in the XRP ledger” which Ripple launched during early 2017. The company has utilized the escrow feature to “establish 55 billion contracts of 1 billion XRP each that will expire on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. As each contract expires, the XRP will become available for Ripple’s use,” with the company stating that it may “use [the] XRP for incentives to market makers who offer tighter spreads for payments and selling XRP to institutional investors.” Ripple adds that any unused XRP will be “return[ed]… to the back of the escrow rotation.” Do you think that the XRP markets will continue to rally heading into 2018?

208,2017-12-30 21:55:39,Ripple,bitcoin,Is the Centralized Ripple Database With the Biggest Pre-Mine Really a Bitcoin Competitor?,"              $BCH               $BTC The rise of ripple (XRP) over the past eight months has been interesting to many digital asset spectators and the network also has its fair share of controversy. At the moment XRPs are trading at an average of $2.20-2.40 per token and ripple’s total market valuation has captured $91Bn this week. Many skeptics are wondering what’s behind the recent XRP price spike and speculate a big correction could be imminent. Also Read: Ripple Gains 1,000% in One Month – Now the Second Largest Cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) is making some serious headway this week as the protocol’s token value has grown exponentially over the past few months. The Ripple network and its parent company, Ripple Labs, considers itself an all-in-one remittance network and currency exchange. The protocol is called a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) which acts as a distributed ledger between a network of nodes. These nodes or validating servers do not offer an incentive like the Bitcoin network’s proof-of-work (PoW) as the network is managed by independently owned servers. This has led to accusations that Ripple’s network is extremely centralized because most validating servers are operated by banks, market makers, and Ripple Labs. Financial institutions that have been using Ripple include Earthpoint, Fidor Bank, Bank of America, and HSBC.  With no PoW and just a group of validating nodes, all 100 billion XRP tokens were created during the initial launch of the Ripple network. 38 billion of these XRPs are currently in circulation, while the founders of the database and the company took the remainder of the XRP holdings. Skeptics say one of the scariest aspects of ripple markets is the fact that Ripple Labs controls over 60 billion XRP which is more than half of what is currently in circulation.   Ripple was established in 2012 by Ryan Fugger and Jed McCaleb and was initially called Ripplepay. The co-founder Jed McCaleb is well known for also helping Mt Gox get its start with Mark Karpeles. McCaleb at the time rebranded the Ripplepay company to Ripple and helped promote the public database until late 2013. McCaleb then left the company that year to start his own venture called the Stellar network which is basically a fork of XRP’s codebase but a different distribution process. In 2014 XRP markets dropped in value considerably as it was rumored that Jed McCaleb was planning to sell off his shares of 9 Billion XRP. It is still unconfirmed to this day if McCaleb actually followed through with the ripple sale. Another Ripple founder, Chris Larsen, donated 7 billion XRP to charity roughly around the same timeframe. Then McCaleb appeared in the headlines again as publications ran stories about him trying to sell more of his founding XRP shares on the Bitstamp exchange. Ripple Labs decided that the sale was not in the best interest of the network so the XRPs were frozen. The “freezing” of McCaleb’s funds revealed an interesting feature tied to the Ripple public database. Ripple Labs can freeze XRP accounts using two possible methods: one can stop the functionality of an individual account while the “global freeze” can bring the entire network to a halt. The global freeze is not a rumor, and Ripple Labs issued a statement about it on August 1, 2014. Further, a Ripple Labs representative told the cryptocurrency columnist, Sean Wince, back in April of 2015 how the freeze works and supposedly users have a choice. “The Ripple protocol allows each gateway to decide its own policy, so users have a choice between using a freeze or no-freeze gateway, depending on their preference,” Monica Long, VP of marketing and communications at Ripple Labs told the reporter Sean Wince.  It is a necessary legal requirement for a gateway to operate in most jurisdictions. It also supports a healthy ecosystem by reducing risks and protecting users. If a user thinks his or her funds were unjustly frozen, he or she can take legal recourse through the appropriate channels. As 2018 approaches, skeptics and speculators are concerned about investors jumping into ripple believing it to be the “next bitcoin.” People are leery because the company holding more than half the currency’s reserves and the centralized XRP freezing features can theoretically censor anyone’s transactions including the entire network. Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts are not the biggest fans of ripple and believe that because it’s not a blockchain, it shouldn’t even be represented on Coinmarketcap. However within the thick of ‘ripple haters,’ markets are doing extremely well, and investors don’t seem to be worried about the XRP ecosystem’s flaws.

209,2017-12-31 12:30:14,Ripple,bitcoin,This Week in Bitcoin: The Bitcoin Fork Tsunami Gives Way to a Ripple,"              $BCH               $BTC Traditionally, nothing happens in the period between Christmas and New Year. It’s a lull devoid of anything newsworthy whatsoever. Except in the world of bitcoin. Miners never stop mining and exchanges never stop exchanging because bitcoin never sleeps – and it certainly doesn’t call in a week-long vacation just cos it’s the holidays. As a consequence, neither did we. While other media sites posted pre-written reviews of the year, we delivered the freshest news as it broke this week in bitcoin. Also read: Trump’s New Tax Bill Means Changes Ahead for U.S. Bitcoiners When dawn broke on January 1st, 2017, there was no inkling of the momentous and historic year that bitcoin was about to embark on. It wasn’t until March that things started getting real crazy, and that breakneck pace was maintained for the remainder of the year. In these final moments of 2017, bitcoin has decided to go out as it came in: quietly and without much fanfare. Prices have been in something of a slump for a few weeks now, leaving the mainstream media with little to get themselves worked up over.  That doesn’t mean that 2017 has ended with a whimper though. Hell naw. Away from price considerations, a lot has happened this week in bitcoin, from new tax legislation to the arrival of a pesky centralized coin determined to launch one final attempt at The Flippening before the year is done. We’ll dispatch ripple back to the bank vaults whence it came shortly, but let’s start with the rest of the week’s news. What has more value – a whole bitcoin or a big bag of alts? The answer surely lies in the former, but with most new entrants to the cryptocurrency markets priced out of owning one whole BTC, cheap alts are catching the eye of investors. The long-term value of these coins is debatable and indeed dubious, but for now at least they’re enjoying a bounce – sometimes an extremely big bounce in the case of this month’s winners, as we reported. Some of those winners rapidly lost their new price points as quickly as they’d been acquired, it should be noted, but that’s what happens when you panic buy altcoins that have been shilled by McAfee. Live and learn. One of the more intriguing stories to emerge this week was that some cryptocurrency exchanges have been closing their doors to new customers. Bitcoin’s so hot right now there’s no more room at the inn. It’s common to embark on retrospectives as the year draws to a close, but this week in bitcoin we traveled back 20 years to revisit a book called The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg. We wrote: Freeing money means freeing people. They explain, “Each transaction will involve the transfer of encrypted multi-hundred-digit prime number sequences…the new digital gold standard or its barter equivalents will be almost impossible to counterfeit…All receipts will be verifiably unique,” which is so exactly spot-on it can take a reader’s breath. Thursday was all about forks, and the growing weariness towards these hastily contrived and often badly thought out bitcoin spin-offs. Bitcoin diamond, bitcoin god, and Segwit2x have all been given the thumbs down by the cryptocurrency community, though bitcoin private, a relaunched Zclassic, looks more interesting. Eric Wall had a lot to say about it in his weekly trading column. Speaking of trading, this week’s most popular post was Seven Deadly Trading Mistakes Every Rookie Makes. Be honest: you’ve committed at least one of these, even if it hurts too much to talk about it. As the weekend drew in, we published a thought-provoking piece on the difficulties of cashing out from crypto to fiat. Seems you might have to wait a while to get your hands on that high performance sports car your Telegram trading buddies have all been touting. Friday’s other essential read was on amendments to the US tax bill, which will compel cryptocurrency holders to tread carefully from now on – if they weren’t already.  2017 was all about bitcoin, except for those occasional weeks when it wasn’t. Remember when ethereum started getting ideas above its station, back in spring? Or how about that time when bitcoin cash looked set to land its own flippening in early November? The last of this year’s challenges to bitcoin came from litecoin…or at least so we thought. Then, out of nowhere, ripple – the great sleeper of the cryptocurrency markets – went on a mazy run, culminating in it usurping ethereum to claim second spot this week. You had a lot to say about ripple’s insurgency in the comments section, and like many here at news.Bitcoin.com were less than enamored with this centralized currency with its insane pre-mine. Five-figure bitcoin doesn’t seem that crazy, all things considered, but $2 ripple? Now that’s a head-turner. We’ve no wish to sign off on the ultimate review of 2017 by speaking of inferior cryptocurrencies, so let’s return to where we started: by toasting what has been a remarkable year for bitcoin. With the crypto community and the world at large now fully aware that decentralized currencies are here to stay, 2018 is shaping up to be the most eagerly anticipated year since the birth of bitcoin. Whatever it holds, we’ll be there to report on the latest drama, scaling solutions, and privacy developments as they unfold.

After falling as low as 37.9% in the last two days of 2017, the market dominance of bitcoin now stands at just 38.2% as of this writing on the first day of 2018. Also Read: First Real Bitcoin Lightning Network Payment Completed via Bitrefill Bitcoin’s current total market capitalization is more than $234 billion, an incredible figure by itself but one that falls in comparison to the grand ecosystem it has birthed. The original cryptocurrency is currently comprising approximately less than 40% of the $615 billion cryptocurrency markets. This is only the second time ever that the dominance of BTC has fallen below this low threshold, the first time being in June of 2017.  Bitcoin has been gaining ground since its June low recently, reaching over 60% market share by early November. The end of 2017 however brought an onslaught of raising contenders to upset BTC’s dominance. Ripple’s XRP is now worth about $88 billion by itself after a massive rally in December. Ethereum’s market cap follows very closely now at over $74 billion. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is also not too far behind with an overall market value of $43 billion. Contributing to the market share loss of bitcoin, there are now 33 altcoins and ICO tokens that are worth over $1 billion by market cap each. These start with ripple, ether and bitcoin cash, but reach all the way down the list to dogecoin. Incredibly, there are now also about 129 altcoins and ICO tokens that are worth between $100 million to $1 billion by market cap each. With a total 1,374 coins now comprising the over $600 billion crypto ecosystem, it should perhaps be no surprise that the long tail of the market is becoming ever fatter today and weighing down its head. Looking at it this way, this development might not be a bad thing for bitcoin but rather a sign of maturity by the market. Unless of course you think most altcoins and ICO tokens are scams anyway.

211,2018-01-03 07:55:53,Ripple,bitcoin,Rising Ripple Threatens to Usurp Bitcoin and Usher In “The Rippening”,"              $BCH               $BTC First came ethereum, which threatened to unseat bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency in an event dubbed The Flippening. Then came bitcoin cash, which lay a glove on bitcoin core in The Cashening. Now, a revitalized ripple (XRP) is eyeing bitcoin’s top spot. Could the centralized cryptocurrency usurp bitcoin’s market cap, heralding The Rippening? Also read: Is the Centralized Ripple Database With the Biggest Pre-Mine Really a Bitcoin Competitor? Scarcely a month passes when an alternative cryptocurrency doesn’t make huge inroads on bitcoin’s dominance. Percentage gains are easy – any coin outside of the top five can realistically double or triple in price within a week. Overtaking bitcoin’s market capitalization however is significantly harder, and while ETH and BCH have both given it their best shot, they’ve yet to achieve that feat.  Despite bitcoin making gains of 14% in the last 24 hours off the back of news on Peter Thiel’s involvement, XRP has outperformed BTC, recording gains of 16%. Ripple at the time of writing had a market cap of $104 billion versus bitcoin’s $245 billion. In other words, ripple is worth 40% of bitcoin’s valuation. Each XRP token is currently trading at around $2.70. If XRP were to reach $6.75 while BTC stood still, it would overtake bitcoin to become the world’s most valuable crypto asset.  It is much easier for a sub-$10 coin to double in value than it is for one costing well into five figures. On December 29, ripple soared from $1.52 to a high of $2.50. If another similar ripple run were to occur, it could send XRP above bitcoin in the space of a week. One ripple will never achieve parity with one bitcoin, as there are a lot of ripples out there – around 39 billion as it stands. Put them all together and, priced at $6.75 a coin, you would be looking at the new cryptocurrency market leader. The psychological effect of bitcoin being toppled, for the first time in cryptocurrency history, would be huge. It would be the equivalent of a rival search engine overtaking Google. The mainstream media would have a field day and the crypto community would be up in arms, but beyond that, not much would change. Bitcoin would retain its use as a store of value, medium of exchange, and pseudonymous digital currency, and ripple would retain its use as, well…what is ripple’s use? Ripple was designed as a SWIFT alternative, providing banks with a means to send funds across borders quickly and at low cost. Like many assets, however, it is primarily used as a speculative instrument. It is the users who determine how an asset is purposed, but it is the markets that set the price – and right now the markets are buying a whole lot of XRP. Most of the trading volume is coming from Korea, although that holds true for the majority of cryptocurrencies. Anecdotal evidence suggests there’s something about ripple that’s alluring to non-traditional cryptocurrency investors. An increasing number of women seem to be taking an interest in XRP, and mainstream coverage has been extensive, with ripple surfacing in the unlikeliest of publications including British tabloid newspapers. Investors are piling into ripple because they see it as a profitable purchase, and thus far they’ve been vindicated. But what happens when the music stops and ripple drops? Naysayers have been predicting a major correction ever since ripple approached the dollar mark, and yet the coin is showing no signs of slowing down. Many crypto newcomers know and care little of Satoshi, decentralization, full nodes, and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, but they recognize profit when they see it, and right now XRP is providing that. The question that would-be investors should be asking themselves is not who’s buying ripple now, but who bought it back in the day when it was trading for cents. The answer to that question includes a number of crypto billionaires. Cofounder and former CEO Chris Larsen owns 5.19 billion XRP, around 13% of the total circulating supply. Forbes reports that this makes ripple’s executive chairman the 15th richest man in America. Current ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also holds a significant number of ripple tokens, with Forbes calculating his net worth to be at least $9.5 billion. Then there’s the 5.3 billion XRP cofounder Jed McCaleb owns. These are held in a fund and released on a monthly basis to prevent the former ripple boss from cashing out and crashing the market. Finally, there’s the additional 55 billion XRP that ripple holds in escrow, over and above the 38.7 billion tokens currently on the market. Add that together and you get a whole lot of ripples, with as much as 35% of the total circulating supply in the hands of just three people. Realistically, Larsen, Garlinghouse, and McCaleb aren’t about to offload 20 billion ripples onto the market. It is not in Larsen’s or Garlinghouse’s interests to do so, while McCaleb, who now runs Stellar (and owns one billion XLM) is unable to do so. There are evident risks inherent to investing in a project whose market price is hostage to a handful of whales. But there are also other reasons why ripple is a controversial cryptocurrency that should be approached with caution. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on how ripple has the power to “freeze” funds at its discretion, and the 55 billion XRP currently on lockdown at ripple XRP are effectively the biggest pre-mine of any digital currency.  As one dissenter pithily put it: “Ripple can f– off. They’re the Intel of crypto – backdoored from the start”. Cryptocurrency maximalists, who are passionate about matters such as financial freedom and the decentralized economy, are especially skeptical of ripple. One thing ripple’s rise arguably does show is that there is an appetite for a centralized currency that isn’t beholden to community concerns. Obtaining consensus for improvements to bitcoin core is notoriously tricky; ripple on the other hand, can be modified by the company without consultation or advance warning. Ripple’s rise means little to the average bitcoiner, whose preference for decentralized financial systems will remain unwavering. The success of XRP could mean a lot to central banks, however, who are watching the token’s ascent with keen interest. How fitting if Ripple, a centralized cryptocurrency, were to prove the gateway drug to a centralized banking coin. What are your thoughts on ripple and where do you see its price going?

212,2018-01-04 13:55:19,Ripple,bitcoin,Ripple Gateways Can Freeze Users’ Funds at Any Time,"              $BCH               $BTC Ripple has been the talk of the town lately thanks to its rocketing value and growing market capitalization that’s making eyes at bitcoin. $1,000 of XRP bought a year ago would be worth half a million dollars today. But away from the price action, there’s an issue bugging ripple that just won’t go away. It’s been alleged for years that Ripple Labs has the power to freeze the balances of account holders. If true, it would be a major cause for concern, especially for proponents of decentralized currency. Also read: Rising Ripple Threatens to Usurp Bitcoin and Usher In “The Rippening” The origins of the Ripple freeze go as follows: In August 2014, Ripple quietly introduced a feature called Freeze. It was put to the test a few months later when Ripple cofounder Jed McCaleb tried to cash out some of his billions in XRP after leaving the company. He’d previously signed an agreement to sell no more than $10,000 of XRP a week, only to attempt to clear $1 million worth through Bitstamp in one go. Upon learning of McCaleb’s actions, Ripple intervened and prevented him from doing so, utilizing its Balance Freeze feature. Built into Ripple gateways such as Bitstamp by default, it enables the company to stop the movement of XRP. During the brouhaha that followed, Bitstamp, caught in the middle, filed a lawsuit to settle the dispute between McCaleb and Ripple Labs. 2015 was a lifetime ago in cryptocurrency, and a lot has happened since then to all of the players caught up in the spat, and to the industry as a whole. Bitstamp, Ripple, and McCaleb would all aver that they’ve moved on to bigger and better things: the former reporting record turnover and trading volume, and McCaleb launching Stellar, whose market cap has quadrupled in a matter of days, catapulting it into the top 10. And then there’s Ripple, which is going great guns. Ripple’s transformation from sluggish cryptocurrency into the hottest ticket in town has been rapid: three months ago, no one wanted to know. Now, traders of all genders, demographics, and territories are invested in ripple, and not just financially, but emotionally too. Anyone who buys an unfancied coin and then watches it moon can’t help but feel a sense of vindication, and a newfound appreciation for the project. At this stage, anything that threatens the coin’s upward trajectory – such as negative news – risks being shot down.  In a report on ripple’s meteoric rise this week, news.Bitcoin.com mentioned the “big freeze”, linking to another recent article on the site which explains this in more detail. Ripple’s defenders hotly dispute the facts of the matter, though, highlighting a sentence on Ripple’s Freeze page which states: “No one can freeze XRP”. So what’s the truth of the matter? Can Ripple freeze users’ funds or not? The answer to Ripple’s capabilities lies in a document the company released in 2014 introducing Balance Freeze and stating: The freeze protocol extension gives gateways the ability to…freeze funds issued to a particular user. Frozen funds may only be sent back to the gateway who issued them. The global freeze feature allows a gateway to freeze all balances issued by it. When you purchase cryptocurrency on an exchange, your account is assigned a virtual balance – a token essentially – correlating to your holdings. Buy 1 BTC, for example, and nothing moves on the blockchain. All that happens is that your USD and BTC account balances are updated. It’s only once a user makes a withdrawal request that an on-chain transaction takes place. Ripple uses a distributed ledger called the Ripple protocol which each Ripple gateway – essentially a bank – keeps a record of. Bitstamp, Gatehub, and The Rock Trading are some of the major gateways partnered with Ripple. Purchase ripple on Bitstamp, for example, and the transaction won’t show up on the Ripple protocol. The ledger will only record the movement of funds when they are withdrawn from the Bitstamp wallet to the customer’s XRP wallet.  The phrase “No one can freeze XRP” is thus a half-truth. Ripple does not possess the power to magically remove the funds from a customer’s personal XRP wallet. For example, it can’t plunder the funds that a holder has stored on their Nano S. If those funds are stored with a Ripple gateway that hasn’t opted out of Freeze, however, they can be locked up. Not only can the XRP be frozen, but so can the account balances associated with its sale, such as USD. Ripple’s defenders claim that in this respect, ripple is no different from any other cryptocurrency. If Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin had 10,000 ETH stolen from him and sent to Bitstamp, for example, he could probably pressure the exchange into freezing that ether while the matter was investigated. The difference with Ripple is that the company has developed a special relationship with its gateways which gives these “banks” unprecedented powers to freeze individual counts on a whim, or on the say-so of Ripple, law enforcement, or regulators. Not only does Ripple encourage the XRP of suspicious accounts to be frozen, but “The financial institution should also freeze the counterparty in any other systems the financial institution operates that are connected to the XRP Ledger”. Your bitcoin; your litecoin; your euros; anything connected to a Ripple gateway can be locked down. No other cryptocurrency has a similar framework in place, which grants exchanges unprecedented powers to lock up funds at the drop of a hat. No one is suggesting that Ripple Labs has a desire to freeze anyone’s funds. That’s not good for business. Nevertheless, a cryptocurrency which enables a centralized authority to freeze funds at the touch of a button defeats the entire purpose of cryptocurrency. Most people have no objection to stemming the funding of terrorists and money launderers. Once a kill switch is created, however, it leads to a slippery slope in which anyone suspected of misbehavior can have their funds seized. As Ripple explains, the feature provides the ability “to freeze individual accounts issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity”. Owning XRP in a country that is hostile to cryptocurrency; possessing an unusually large amount of XRP; signing up to a Ripple gateway exchange from a banned country: all could be grounds for freezing your account. If law enforcement suspected a cryptocurrency holder was engaged in criminal behavior, they could try to obtain a subpoena granting permission to seize that individual’s exchange balance – and would be required to submit evidence to show there was probable cause for doing so. But if that exchange happened to be a Ripple gateway, they could simply pick up the phone and ask for the Big Button of Freeze to be pressed. And that’s the difference between ripple and other cryptocurrencies.  Keeping so much as 1 XRP on a gateway exchange would technically be enough to see all of your fiat and crypto balances frozen. There are ways to obtain and transact XRP without going near a gateway that possesses special powers.

No decision to add new assets to either GDAX or Coinbase has been made, the exchange said in a blog post dismissing any statements to the contrary. Ripple lost some $30 billion of market capitalization on the day of the announcement.  Also read: Rising Ripple Threatens to Usurp Bitcoin and Usher In “The Rippening” The clarification on the matter came in response to unverified rumors and unfounded reports that Coinbase might add Ripple to its cryptocurrency markets. They have most certainly helped fuel Ripple’s surge that doubled its price in a week. After Coinbase stated it had no intentions to change its Digital Asset Framework in the short run, Ripple wobbled in charts and lost 20 percent of its value before it rebounded a little. Its capitalization is now below $125 billion, down from Thursday’s peak at almost $149 billion. One XRP coin is currently trading for less than $3.25 USD at the time of publishing according to Coinmarketcap.  Coinbase is the biggest cryptocurrency marketplace in the US and operates the Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), a platform for trading a variety of digital assets, and a broker processing crypto-fiat transactions. It trades Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and has added Bitcoin Cash support last month. BCH jumped 70% after the latest update of its Digital Asset Framework. The December 17 announcement had been proceeded by a leak that attracted a lot of criticism and led to an internal investigation. Yesterday Coinbase made it clear that it had no immediate plans to start trading Ripple, although XRP was not explicitly mentioned in its blog post: We have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company. Coinbase also reminded that its Digital Asset Framework, released a few months ago, highlights the criteria for supporting new assets. It added that a committee of internal experts was responsible for determining whether and when new assets would be added and insisted that these employees were subject to confidentiality and trading restrictions.  Ripple’s rise made it the second most valued cryptocurrency after Bitcoin during a spell when BTC saw its market share falling below 40%. XRP was trading for as little as $0.006 in January and ended 2017 at a price of $2.30 USD. A few days ago the current and former CEOs of the company, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, were ranking among the wealthiest Americans according to Forbes. Larsen, cofounder and Executive Chairman, who reportedly has the largest stash of ripples, would have placed somewhere between Steve Ballmer and Mark Zuckerberg in the 400 richest people list on Monday. But there have been some ups and downs since then – Ether passed the $1,000 barrier and Bitcoin is touching $16,000 again. In the volatile world of digital money, following experts’ advice and staring at charts doesn’t always help to find a way to sustainable growth and lasting wealth.

214,2018-01-06 16:36:32,Ripple,bitcoin,Trading Tip `The Wall´ – Did Ripple Almost Dethrone Bitcoin “Using This One Simple Trick”?,"              $BCH               $BTC 2017 was the year cryptocurrency speculation went mainstream, which is something many bitcoiners have been yearning to happen for years. But going mainstream means that the market is no longer dominated by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and until Wall Street steps in, we’re simply going to have to accept that mainstream speculators with little knowledge of cryptocurrencies are in charge of the market. Also read: Absurd Profits from Zclassic a.k.a. Bitcoin Private If you’re a cryptocurrency old-timer, things that annoy you will become popular for reasons that seem unimaginably stupid. If you were a musician in 2012 and competing for the #1 spot on YouTube, it didn’t matter if you were the best singer in the world if your competition was “Oppa Gangnam Style”. In the same way, it won’t matter if your cryptocurrency is the most sophisticated and decentralized in the world, if the market doesn’t value those characteristics. 
 To explain what I mean, I’ve analyzed the percentage gains of each of the top 27 coins by market cap since 2017. One thing that is clear to me is that the cryptocurrency characteristic the market favored more than anything else in 2017 was not so much decentralization, technological soundness or real world usage, but rather the dollar digit bracket the coin belonged to; in this case, sub-cent unit prices.  Of course, the unit price of a coin is a totally senseless basis for making investment choices on. Any cryptocurrency–even Bitcoin–could have been a sub-cent item, if Satoshi chose the final cap to be 21 quadrillion instead of 21 million. In that case, the unit price of a bitcoin (price per each whole bitcoin) would be $0.00001697 right now instead of $16,790 but the total market cap would still have been $284 billion. Everything would be the same, except that everyone would have a million times more bitcoin–and the unit price would be cheaper. Since bitcoins (as well as many other cryptocurrencies) are divisible down to 10^8 satoshis (smaller units), it doesn’t really matter what the supply is, as long as there’s enough “particles” of the currency to go around for the economic use cases imagined to function properly. The number itself is not important. But it does directly effect the unit prices, which apparently has an enormous impact of the investment choices of mainstream investors. As stupid as it may seem, I contend that apart from what’s outlined in this great summary, the perceived “cheapness” of Ripple’s XRP (100 billion supply) is one of the reasons why it overtook Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency in the world by implied market cap this week. Ripple $XRP last night overtook Bitcoin $BTC as the largest cryptocurrency by fully diluted market cap. Further to my tweet a few weeks ago – I'd be very cautious in the space. #dashfortrash pic.twitter.com/qbIorRfMES — Leon Warburton (@Leon_Warburton) January 4, 2018  The reason why we look at market caps when we compare coins is because that’s how we compare the values of a cryptocurrency as a whole rather than just looking at the unit prices, which we know, as illustrated before, to be completely arbitrary and therefore not a good measure of anything. To visualize this is in the clearest way possible, we can normalize the supply for different altcoins to see what the prices really would look like if they all had the same supply. This is how they would compare (as of 5 Jan 2017): Another interesting aspect to look at is how many units of each altcoin you need to hold to own the equivalent of 1 bitcoin of that coin:  In these tables, I’m using the “fully diluted market cap” (max supply) as a basis for the normalization. The currencies for which the max supply is unknown such as Ethereum, I’ve used the Y2050 estimations given by Onchainfx(*). The calculation I’ve used for the  normalization table is as follows: Altcoin price x Altcoin max cap / 21M And the bitcoin equivalent altcoin holding amounts: Altcoin max cap / 21M I recommend always doing this when trying to gauge the relative value of a coin to bitcoin for long-term investments. In my opinion, it’s better than looking at unit prices or market caps based on circulating supply, because it’s the only way to correctly assess the actual valuation you’re giving a coin when buying. I think the easiest way to understand what I mean is by looking at Zcash as an example. Zcash’s supply when all coins are mined will be the same as bitcoin, 21 million, but currently, there’s only ~3 million mined (circulating supply). As such, when you’re looking at sites like Coinmarketcap, it will tell you that Zcash has a market cap of just $1.7 billion. That’s just 0.6% of bitcoins market cap and places Zcash far down the list, at #27 where it looks small and leaves much room for growth.  But the price of Zcash is $589 which is actually 3.5% of bitcoin’s $16,790. If you’re buying with bitcoin, that means you have to pay 0.035 bitcoin to buy Zcash. Another thing you have to factor in when buying Zcash at $589 is that in order for Zcash to actually keep that price over time, Zcash must amass a market cap of $12bn, climbing to what’s currently the 12th spot on Coinmarketcap. And even if Zcash were to somehow do that, you would still only break even on your investment–because you bought it at a price ($589) that implied a valuation of $12bn. That’s the reason why the Onchainfx site is listing the coins the way they are–because it tells us what the implied valuation are for coins when bought at current prices. Unfortunately, using the slightly deceitful metric “circulating supply” seems to be the norm when comparing valuations in the crypto-space. In a recent example, the Twitter-user @boxmining shared a tweet where he showed a similar supply-normalized valuation as mine but based off of circulating supply: Removing Unit Bias. If everything had the same supply cap as Bitcoin, would you still buy it? pic.twitter.com/0xrDiytPzR — boxmining (@boxmining) January 5, 2018  With this tweet he got the key message across – at the time, the implied valuation of XRP valued it above bitcoin. But if we look carefully, we’ll see Zcash at #28 on that list, with the deceitful price tag of $105, implying that the relative price of Zcash to Bitcoin is 0.6%, when as we know in reality, you have to pay 0.035 bitcoins (3.5% for a Zcash). The point I want to make is that you can get far in your ambitions to become a more informed trader than most people in the market just by using common sense and a calculator. But being able to properly compare coin valuations doesn’t matter if nobody else is doing it — at least not in the short term. It can take a long time before the market fundamentals eventually force these prices to sort themselves out. And until they do, I recommend you do your diligence to make sure you’re on the right side of that correction. (*) For Qtum, Onchainfx estimates the Y2050 supply to be 100 billion, which is erroneous. Speaking to one of the Qtum developers, David Jaenson, I confirmed this number to instead be 107822406.25.

215,2018-01-21 06:00:29,Ripple,bitcoin,The Rise and Fall of Ripple is a Case Study in Mass Hysteria,"              $BCH               $BTC Through late 2017 and early 2018, ripple was the darling of cryptocurrency. Mainstream media couldn’t get enough of it, South Koreans couldn’t get enough of it, and nor could crypto newcomers, who had XRP top of their shopping list. Crypto moves at a blistering pace, though, and ripple’s decline has been as rapid as its rise. Now the dust has settled and the hype dissipated, a retrospective reveals the mass hysteria behind the rise and fall of ripple. Also read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrency Prices Rebound But Uncertainty Still Lingers In the Middle Ages, a group of nuns in a French convent began randomly mewing like cats. In 1518, the Dancing Plague in Strasbourg caused people to keel over from exhaustion after gyrating for days. In 1962, a laughter epidemic broke out in a girls’ boarding school in Tanzania. And in late 2017, the world became convinced that ripple was a valuable commodity. As ripple’s market capitalization surged, there was even talk of it overtaking bitcoin to become the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. Looking through the timeline reveals the sequence of events that contributed to the rise and fall of XRP. Up until two months ago, ripple was the great sleeper of cryptocurrency. Due to the vast number of XRP in existence, its huge market cap meant it was a constant presence in the cryptocurrency top 10. Traders hated it though, dubbing it Cripple, while decentralization purists had more ideological reasons for disliking XRP, arguing that it wasn’t even a cryptocurrency.  After briefly surging in May, ripple entered into a lengthy slump. Between August and December 2017, XRP traded at between 16 and 26 cents, while other altcoins were recording exponential gains. It seemed that ripple’s time would never come. But then, on December 9, XRP began to climb. Between December 9 and 16, ripple grows from 24 cents to 88 cents, gaining 366% in a week. 12/13: Forbes asks “Is XRP The Next Crypto Rocket ‘To The Moon’?  From December 17-22, ripple rises from 76 cents to $1.19, growing another 160% in under a week. The coin is now up 500% in a fortnight. 12/17: Oracle Times writes “3 Reasons Why Amazon Will Choose Ripple (XRP) in 2018” 12/22: Bloomberg writes “Bitcoin Is So 2017 as Ripple Soars at Year End”  Ripple finishes the year with another huge leap, going from $1.19 on December 23 to $2.24 on December 29, gaining 188%.  12/30: News.bitcoin.com asks “Is the Centralized Ripple Database With the Biggest Pre-Mine Really a Bitcoin Competitor? Ripple starts the year with another run, going from a low of $1.93 on December 31 to an all-time high of $3.86 on January 4.  01/02: In a soon to be notorious feature, CNBC educates its readers on “How to buy ripple, one of the hottest bitcoin competitors”. On the same day, Forbes’ Laura Shin points out that two of Ripple’s founders are now billionaires, with Chris Larsen the 15th richest man in America. Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence stacks up suggesting that office workers, moms, manual laborers, and many others with no previous knowledge or interest in cryptocurrency are asking about ripple. 01/03: News.Bitcoin.com notes how ripple’s market cap is now 40% that of bitcoin’s, raising the possibility of “The Rippening”. 01/04: As ripple hits its all time high, news.Bitcoin.com explains that Ripple Gateways Can Freeze Users’ Funds at Any Time. Ripple’s chief cryptographer David Schwartz rages hard and pens a Quora rebuttal in which he notes that “Ripple is not a gateway and only gateways can freeze.” So exactly what the article title said then. On the same day, NYT’s Nathaniel Popper writes a Ripple feature that’s widely perceived as negative, quoting Ari Paul as saying “I’m not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP’s valuation”. Popper finishes “even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple’s software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices.” 01/05: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse lashes out at Popper on Twitter:  Over the next four days, ripple dips slightly, but by January 8 is still sitting at $3.36, up 1,400% in a month.  01/05: Coinbase rejects rumors that it is planning to add new assets, scorching the prospect of XRP being listed. 01/07: British newspapers are now heavily shilling ripple, with the Express describing it as “the exciting new cryptocurrency that has sparked interest from crypto investors”. In another piece filed the same day, it asks “Is it better to invest in XRP than Bitcoin?” 01/08: News.Bitcoin.com describes ripple as vaporware, noting “Ripple claims to have signed up over 100 banks, but the trouble is none of them seem to be using XRP tokens for money transfer”. Ripple supporters are not amused.   Over the course of the next week, ripple begins to drop and then keeps on dropping, reaching a low of 89 cents on January 16 as the entire crypto market takes a tumble. It is now down 430% from its peak 12 days earlier and is no longer the second largest cryptocurrency.  01/10: Three days after touting ripple as a bitcoin competitor, the Express writes: “Why is XRP falling so fast? What’s happening to Ripple?” 01/11: News that Ripple has signed an agreement with a money transfer service causes XRP to climb 20% before sliding again as it becomes apparent that Moneygram are only testing ripple in a single location. 01/16: Forbes documents the decline of ripple, quoting one analyst as saying: “You couldn’t turn on your TV last week and not hear about XRP or its CEO…Once Coinbase said they weren’t adding any new assets the pullback started. Now everyone is continuing to take profits.” One commenter tweets “That CNBC pump is gonna be stock footage in every documentary they make about 2018 for the next 50 years.”  As the crypto markets start to recover, ripple claws back some of its losses, reaching $1.43 on January 21. It is still up almost 600% from the start of December, but is down approx. 60% from its peak. “Early adopters” who bought XRP a month ago are in profit, but the masses who bought in at peak mania are heavily in the red. The mainstream media stop writing about ripple, and housewives shelve plans to put their savings into “the next bitcoin”. 01/18: Financial Times writes how it “spoke to 16 banks and financial services companies publicly linked to Ripple. Most had not yet gone beyond testing…none of the banks who spoke to the FT had used XRP.”  Where ripple goes next remains to be seen, though the Classic Stages of a Bubble chart has some firm suggestions:  The reality may prove more prosaic: ripple is unlikely to disappear from trace, but nor is it likely to trouble bitcoin’s market cap, which is now 3.5x greater than that of the centralized pretender which, for three heady days in January 2018, looked like it might actually be capable of achieving The Rippening. If Ripple can finally persuade a major bank to use XRP, and not just for test purposes, it could see another surge. Right now though, the heady days of $3+ ripple seem like a lifetime ago.  Ripple isn’t the first asset to be shilled to the moon and back, and it certainly won’t be the last. When the cryptocurrency history books are written, ripple will go down as a textbook case of mass hysteria, right up there with the dancing plague and the laughter epidemic.

The latest example is a religious body that now allows members to donate using cryptocurrency. Also Read: U.S. Rating Agency to Issue Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Grades Wednesday ICF Zurich, an evangelical church from the largest city in Switzerland, has begun accepting voluntary offerings from its parishioners using cryptocurrency. According to its website, the church accepts donations directly via bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), ripple (XRP) and stellar lumen (XLM). “Digital currencies and the blockchain technology will change our daily lives more and more in the next years,” the spokesperson of the church, Nicolas Legler, told Swiss news agency Idea. “Cryptocurrencies will be implemented, be it Bitcoin or other currencies controlled by the State. We are convinced that this technology will soon belong to our daily lives. Twenty years ago, no one would have believed that internet would determine our lives so much,” he added. According to an evangelical European news portal, this church is known for its use of all kinds of new technologies in its worship services and has many young members, some of which “are increasingly using this way of doing financial transfers.” This explains the choice of accepting cryptocurrency now, as the invention has taken a strong hold on early adopters in Switzerland, as it can help the church appear innovative and relevant to them. We should also note that this is just another example of how young people are changing the donations practice. A couple of notable other examples include Pineapple Fund, the $86 million bitcoin charity which contributed towards developing MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, scalable healthcare in Nepal, combating elephant poachers, testing universal basic income in Africa, and much more; as well as Paxful’s #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative to help fund 100 schools in developing countries.

217,2018-02-07 11:00:19,Ripple,bitcoin,New Research Suggests Ripple Is Even More Centralized Than Previously Thought,"              $BCH               $BTC Despite being associated with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, ripple’s status as a decentralized currency is a matter of dispute. Critics have taken aim at XRP for years, claiming that Ripple exerts an unprecedented degree of control over transactions, something the company has always denied. A new report from Bitmex Research, whose cryptocurrency analysis carries great weight, suggests that ripple may be even more centralized than previously thought. Also read: The Rise and Fall of Ripple is a Case Study in Mass Hysteria The Bitmex blog, operated by the exchange famed for its 100x leverage, isn’t like other blogs. Instead of being ephemeral and newsy, it’s characterized by deep and thoughtful research that is unlike anything else within the crypto space. When a new blog post is published, the community takes notice. On Monday, the latest Bitmex Research post, “The Ripple story”, arrived. Written more like an academic paper than a blog, it delves into the origins and backstory to Ripple in forensic detail. While the entire report will be of interest to anyone trying to gauge what to make of Ripple, it is the section regarding centralization that has provoked the most interest. In January, news.Bitcoin.com reported on Ripple Gateways’ ability to freeze users’ funds, something the company’s chief cryptographer David Schwartz bitterly protested. The Bitmex blog post explores this allegation at length, explaining: In 2015, Ripple took advantage of the Ripple freeze feature instituted in August 2014. The Bitstamp gateway froze funds belonging to a family member of Jed McCaleb. Some consider this ironic: Ripple originally stated that the freeze feature was implemented to enable gateways to comply with orders from law enforcement yet the first actual usage of the feature appears to have been an order to comply with an instruction from the Ripple company itself, against one of the founders. This information was already in the public domain thanks to to court documents, as was the news that the first 32,000 block headers from the Ripple ledger are missing, making it impossible to fully audit the company all the way back to when 100 billion XRP were created. 2013 is a long time ago in cryptocurrency history, and a lot has happened since then, both to Ripple and to the industry in general. Bitmex does a meticulous job of tracking the ups, downs and labyrinthine goings on at Ripple HQ – or Ripple Labs as the company was known at one stage in its history. The most explosive part of the Bitmex blog regards the extent to which Ripple is centralized, and here the report’s author digs up new information that had not previously been documented: “In January 2018, the BitMEX Research team installed and ran a copy of Rippled for the purpose of this report. The node operated by downloading a list of five public keys from the server v1.ripple.com…All five keys are assigned to Ripple.com. The software indicates that four of the five keys are required to support a proposal in order for it to be accepted.” Since the keys were all downloaded from the Ripple.com server, Ripple is essentially in complete control of moving the ledger forward, so one could say that the system is centralised. Indeed, our node indicates that the keys expire on 1 February 2018 (just a few days after the screenshot), implying the software will need to visit Ripple.com’s server again to download a new set of keys. As the report acknowledges, there are many benefits to centralized systems from a performance perspective, however “some Ripple marketing, like the image below, contends that the Ripple system is distributed, which some may consider misleading”. There are two sides to every story of course, and Ripple’s passionate chief cryptographer wasted no time in seeking to clarify a few points that were raised in the report. The Bitmex blog concludes by saying “The real mystery about Ripple is that, given the large market value of the system, why are all the Bitcoin critics so silent?” This claim is debatable, for numerous high profile Twitter commenters and major publications, including this one, have repeatedly sought to shed light on Ripple’s token model, freeze feature, and degree of centralization. It may be more accurate to conclude that bitcoiners are well aware of Ripple and have elected to give the company and its coin a wide berth for the reasons outlined above.  Newcomers, who comprise the bulk of the crypto community these days, either don’t know or more likely don’t care about principles such as decentralization or the fact that the company controls the bulk of all XRP in existence. Regardless of one’s stance on Ripple and its XRP currency, the Bitmex report sheds welcome light on a company whose beginnings and operations are shrouded in mystery.
