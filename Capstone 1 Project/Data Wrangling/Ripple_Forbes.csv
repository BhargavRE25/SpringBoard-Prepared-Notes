(Photo by Ulrich Baumgarten via Getty Images) Ripple solidifies #3 cryptocurrency spot with a $35.7B market cap. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] After a general trend of consolidation in the worldwide cryptocurrency market—following drops in the Dow Jones industrial average, Facebook banning cryptocurrency advertising, news of Chinese and South Korean regulation, India pushing toward a crackdown and news of Tether and Bitfinex subpoenas—the market cap is beginning to inch back up after January's lows. One coin in particular made big leaps overnight (PST): Ripple (XRP). Disclosure: I own some Ripple.  According to CoinMarketCap, Ripple was trading for $0.771540 USD at 9:19pm PST Feb. 8. By 6:44am on Feb. 9, that number was $0.931411—a jump of 21 percent in just 10 hours. 
 Ripple 24-hour trading chart The price is currently $0.916888, 21 percent higher than it was a day ago. This performance is 2-4x higher than other major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Cardano.Continued from page 1 After exhibiting unprecedented growth in December 2017, Ripple then became the worst-performing major coin of January, performing at -49.56 percent. The recent surge follows announcements of partnerships with IDT, Mercury FX, MoneyGram and Santander as well as an ""open payments corridor"" to China via LianLian Yintong Electronic Payment Company. Furthering its position in Asia, SBI announced the creation SBI Virtual Currencies on Jan. 30, an exchange that will help Asian markets bridge the gap from fiat to crypto. Ripple still has a long way to go to reclaim its #2 spot on the cryptocurrency market, as Ethereum is holding strong with $83.3B—more than double Ripple's current market cap.

 Matthew Mellon Individual Investor Crypto Net Worth: $900 million-$1 billion* Matthew Mellon This heir to one of America's great banking fortunes, and a former chair of the New York Republican Party's finance committee, has struggled with drug addiction. So when he began dabbling heavily in cryptocurrencies years ago, his friends and family tried to dissuade him, figuring it was another erratic obsession. And, indeed, he abandoned some early investments and sold his Bitcoin a few years ago. 
 But then Mellon got turned on to XRP, spending some $2 million to acquire coins, which he liked because it's one of the few cryptocurrencies that are working within the banking system. ""Crypto is scary and dark. It's anti-America,"" says Mellon, 54. ""I am pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank. That's why I went with Ripple."" Mellon's XRP is worth around $1 billion. Recently divorced, he parties in a posh Los Angeles house he rents for $150,000 month. ""It's $1 billion virtually for free. I actually have earned it because I was the only person who was willing to raise his hand,"" says Mellon.

2018-01-02 08:00:00,Ripple,forbes,Meet The Crypto Billionaires Getting Rich From Ripple's XRP,"The value of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 to more than $600 billion, minting scores of crypto millionaires.  A few lucky holders are also breathing the rarefied air of the billionaires club — and not just in the most valuable cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which has a market capitalization of $237 billion. Two billionaires who now easily rank among the wealthiest Americans include the current and former CEOs of Ripple, a San Francisco-based company using blockchain technology in international financial transactions. It issues a token called XRP that, as of Monday, January 1, had a market capitalization of $88.9 billion; each XRP was trading at $2.39, according to Coinmarketcap. Just the week before, Ripple had surpassed Ethereum to become the second-most-valuable crypto asset. Cofounder and former CEO Chris Larsen, who stepped down in November 2016 and now serves as executive chairman of Ripple, has 5.19 billion XRP in his personal holdings and a 17% stake in the company, according to sources at Ripple. That gives him a net worth of $37.3 billion, using Monday’s exchange rate. 
 Chris Larsen, Ripple cofounder, executive chairman and former CEO That would make him the 15th richest American on the 2017 Forbes 400 list as of Monday, tying him with Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO and current owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers. He ranks a bit ahead of Abigail Johnson, the CEO of Fidelity, who is herself a big cryptocurrency fan, plus  hedge funder Ray Dalio and investor Carl Icahn, both of whom have made headlines for calling Bitcoin a bubble.  Current Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse owns a 6.3% stake in Ripple, according to a source at the company, and owns additional XRP tokens. He has a net worth of at least $9.5 billion. That would land him at around 54 on the list, with the addition of Larsen, just two slots below Charles Schwab. Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive officer of Ripple XRP skyrocketed in 2017 from $0.006 on January 1 to $2.30 on December 31 — a return of 38,000%.  A third person who’s gotten rich on XRP is Ripple cofounder Jed McCaleb, who left the company in 2013 and later came to an agreement with Ripple over the XRP he owns. McCaleb said he donated 2 billion XRP to a donor-advised fund. The remaining 5.3 billion XRP as of February 2016 are in a custody account at Ripple and are meted out to him on a monthly basis. Since the agreement was reached, he has been allowed to sell less than 1% of average daily volume on one exchange that now itself accounts for only 1%-2% of all XRP trading volume. If McCaleb had access to all of the XRP at once, he would be a billionaire.  (Additionally, McCaleb, who founded Mt. Gox in 2010, says he has no Bitcoins left, having sold them to found Ripple. Since leaving Ripple, he has since gone on to found Stellar, but his one billion Lumens, each valued at 48 cents, do not make him a billionaire and won’t vest for a couple years.) Ripple says it has more than 100 customers, such as American Express and Santander, who are collaborating on U.S-to-U.K. payments using Ripple technology.  XRP, being issued by a company, is less decentralized than many other cryptocurrencies. For instance, Ripple itself holds 61.3 billion XRP, including 55 billion that it keeps in escrow. Only 38.7 billion XRP tokens have been distributed. In contrast, Bitcoin is much less concentrated, though many early holders have a large number of coins. Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, is believed to own the largest amount, with estimated holdings of 980,000 Bitcoins ($13.4 billion by Monday's Bitcoin price). That represents only 5.8% of all Bitcoins currently in existence. One thing is very clear: the huge swings in the value of Ripple, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mean that there is no guarantee that any of these folks will still be billionaires when Forbes publishes its next list in March.

2018-01-14 11:46:00,Ripple,forbes,3 Reasons To Not Get Excited About Seagate's Investment In Ripple/XRP,"In May 2015, Seagate made an investment in Ripple Labs, which created the XRP cryptocurrency. Many tech companies make strategic investments so that they can gain access to technologies, which they believe could be useful for their business or in areas they want to explore. At the time one Ripple or XRP was worth less than a penny vs. the $1.83 it is currently trading. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency Bitcoin. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) On Monday morning this past week, a Seeking Alpha article postulated that Seagate’s investment in Ripple could be worth close to $8 billion or half of the company’s market cap. When the stock opened for trading, it spiked up from the previous Friday’s close of $42.94 to $49.70, up 19%. It fell back during the day but still closed up 7% at $46.00. After the market closed on Monday, Seagate positively preannounced its December quarter results. However, it appears that investors were expecting strong results as the stock was up less than 1% on Tuesday and closed at $46.39. For the week, it did increase over $8 or 19%. While the positive pre-announcement and the stock market strength probably contributed to the rise, it appears the Seeking Alpha article also helped. 
 Investment is worth about $1 billion (at current pricing) In reading through three analysts reports, it appears that Seagate’s investment in Ripple is significantly less than what was calculated in the Seeking Alpha article. RBC’s Seagate analyst Amit Daryanani talked with the company’s management and based on their discussion he believes it owns a 2%-3% stake in Ripple through its participation in the Series A and B rounds in 2015 and 2016. Ripple in turn owns about 60% of the actual XRP tokens. At the current market cap of $71 billion (XRP tokens are currently at $1.83), a 2.5% ownership of Ripple Labs, which controls 60% of the tokens, is worth just over $1 billion. This in turn is about 7% of Seagate’s market cap.  Cryptocurrencies are very volatile Three months ago, Ripple’s XRP price was $0.26, which translated to a $10 billion market cap. On Monday, its price ranged from $1.93 to $2.78 per Yahoo! Finance, which means its market cap had about a $33 BILLION market cap swing in 1 DAY.Continued from page 1 If Ripple was to unload a large percentage of its XRP holdings, it would almost assuredly crash the value of the tokens which would decrease the value of Seagate’s investment. Don’t count your chickens before they hatch Seagate’s investment is in Ripple Labs, which owns about 60% of the XRP token. This isn’t the same as owning a lot of cryptocurrency that can be liquidated. This could be a very nice windfall for Seagate but unless Ripple Labs sells the tokens and distributes the cash, it could be hard for Seagate to monetize this investment. This then means the investment’s value should be discounted to less than $1 billion.

 A 'Tell Tale Sign' While Ripple announced new partnerships on Wednesday, January 24, markets did not react, meaning that the positive news did not provoke any significant change in price. Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments, described this as a ""tell tale sign of sentimental trading.""  ""Any other coin would have surged on the news of Partnerships,"" he emphasized, adding that ""XRP is making international payments and foreign exchange transactions easy and at a discount on its XRapid platform.""  Widespread Speculation Marouane Garcon, managing director of Amulet, a crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform that focuses on customer success and usability, commented on all the speculation surrounding XRP. ""Investors were accumulating at the lower levels in anticipation of another run,"" said Garcon.  ""There are still a lot of quasi believers in XRP and this price fluctuation is a prime example of that,"" he added. Iqbal Gandham, U.K. managing director for eToro, offered a similar point of view. ""It's purely a general market sentiment combined with a knowledge that ripple was much higher a few weeks ago and looks cheap,"" he said. ""Money comes in, but when a good bull run does not occur people panic on bad general news."" Ripple's Bright Future Regardless of what XRP does in the short-term, several analysts were optimistic about Ripple's future in the long-term. ""I still believe Ripple has a strong future among mainstream traders who take investment cues"" from major media outlets, said Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA.  ""Ripple continues to increase it platform use and that will add value to coin,"" stated Thorngren. ""With Ripple being the fastest and most cost efficient of the digital platforms it is no wonder why MoneyGram, IDT Corp and Mercury FX have aligned themselves here.""  As a result of all this, ""Serious Investors should take advantage of the prices here while they can,"" stated Thorngren.  Garcon, however, offered a different point of view, stating that many market observers are skeptical. ""People want adoption,"" he said. ""People want earth shattering news.   ""XRP will continue to float between $1-$2 until they deliver earth shaking news,"" stated Garcon.  Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/01/26/ripple-drops-more-than-30-in-a-week-as-hype-fades/
2017-12-20 10:27:00,Ripple,forbes,The Bear Case For XRP: Bitcoin Futures Edition,"Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets at Ripple Labs Inc., speaks during the Consensus: Invest event in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017. Consensus: Invest, the world's first digital asset investor outlook event hosted by CoinDesk, brings institutional investors, hedge funds, money managers, banks, and family offices together to get connected with how to invest, store, trade and judge value in this new asset class. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg In August, the hedge I cofounded, Multicoin Capital, published an analysis of XRP, the native token of the Ripple network. We presented a bearish view of XRP tokens. A quick summary: Ripple, Inc. — the company that builds and maintains the Ripple network — has built a blockchain-based system that banks use to issue IOUs and settle debts. XRP has two uses: to pay fees on the Ripple network, and as a “bridge currency” for value transfers between any two institutions that don’t have a trusted relationship. However, its native token, XRP, is simply not necessary for the network to function. Since the Ripple network is permissioned as a direct result of its unique node list (UNL) system, the risk of rational actors spamming the network is low. It’s unlikely that JP Morgan would spam Bank of America, or that Hana Group of South Korea would spam Fidelity. Even if these institutions don’t trust one another, they still want to conduct business with one another. Spamming other banks just doesn’t make any sense. 
 The other intended use for XRP is to act as a “bridge currency:” If a scenario arises in which two financial institutions need to settle IOUs in local currencies, how does the debtor acquire the local currency of the creditor? Many currency pairs simply don’t exhibit substantial trading volume, for example, Kenyan dollars to South Korean won. Although most currency pairs are not substantial by volume relative to USD-Euro, the combination of long tails of currency pairs grows factorially, as a function of n!. Given that there are 180 fiat currencies around the world, there are about 16,000 currency pairs. Today, this problem is usually solved by using a market maker which provides liquidity in each currency to USD because USD is the global reserve currency. Ripple, Inc. proposes that financial institutions solve this problem using the Ripple network and XRP instead of the legacy banking infrastructure and USD. The Ripple network is superior as payment rail system relative to the legacy financial infrastructure. However, it just doesn’t make sense that rational financial institutions will voluntarily use XRP as a reserve currency to settle transactions because XRP will always be -- by definition -- less liquid than a global reserve such as Bitcoin. Regardless of the quality of the underlying technological infrastructure, the single most important attribute of a global reserve currency is liquidity. This is why USD reigns supreme: the largest economy in the world by definition has the largest amount of liquidity for most currency pairs. Given XRP’s continued meteoric rise over the last 3-4 months, we decided to revisit our original thesis. In the last month, we’ve spoken with blockchain leads at major international remittance companies, traditional asset management firms, commercial banks, and investment banks. The individuals we spoke with have all evaluated Ripple’s solution and XRP. All of them used the system in some capacity, and all of them independently came to the same conclusion: if their institution were to ever come to use the Ripple network to settle transactions -- which they deemed unlikely -- they would want to use the global reserve currency for settlements, and not XRP. The global reserve currency is far more likely to be BTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ether (ETH) because these are permissionless financial systems and experience significant native demand from consumers and businesses all over the world. It simply doesn’t make any sense that XRP -- as a permissioned currency that only banks can access in substantial quantities -- will ever have more liquidity than a global reserve that’s used by billions of people. The magnitude of the liquidity discrepancy between currency pairs is enormous. Over the last 30 days, the average daily volume for BTC was just shy of $10 billion, and for XRP was about $500 million. This gap is likely to grow as BTC becomes a global, censorship-resistant, store of value.Continued from page 1 Ripple Inc. is aware of this problem: they recently launched a liquidity program. Since Ripple Inc. owns about 2/3 of total XRP supply – with an implied valuation of $45-50 billion based on current spot prices – they are deliberately discounting their service at a significant rate to entice their customers to use XRP rather than BTC. This artificial liquidity is just - artificial. It will run out. This will maintain a floor of liquidity for XRP in the short term, but there’s just no way for this program to provide the liquidity necessary to exceed that of the global reserve. Unfortunately for XRP holders, the probability of XRP becoming the global reserve just became substantially more difficult. The CBOE and CME -- two of the world’s largest futures exchanges -- just launched Bitcoin futures trading. The magnitude of this development cannot be overstated. This hinders XRP’s chances of becoming the global reserve currency. For large financial institutions, the single largest problem with cryptocurrencies, other than perhaps custodianship, is price volatility. Futures can be used to hedge price risk. In the next few months, as these futures markets mature, banks will be able to buy and hold billions of dollars worth of BTC on their balance sheets while hedging out price risk. Given this, why would any rational financial institution want to use XRP as the bridge currency to settle transactions? BTC now has two huge advantages: ~20x the liquidity, and a futures market that allows banks to hedge price risk while holding large amounts of BTC. XRP bulls counter that XRP offers faster settlements times and lower fees than BTC. This is true, but irrelevant. The value of liquidity and ability to hedge price risk are far more important than these two relatively insignificant technology details. 
 So why does XRP keep pumping? The team is one of the best in crypto. The venture capital investors backing Ripple Inc. are top notch. They continue to announce new banking partners. I fully expect these banks to use Ripple’s software, and experiment with XRP. But... We maintain our position: in the long run, we’re bearish on XRP. We simply don’t see any series of events that can occur that would cause financial institutions to voluntarily adopt XRP over the global reserve. Having said that, given the state of crypto markets today, XRP could keep pumping. There’s really not a good objective valuation model for XRP given the intrinsic velocity problem that it faces, so it could 5x before our thesis is reflected in XRP price movements. “In the short term, the market is a voting machine; in the long term, it’s a weighing machine.” - Warren Buffett Update 12/21/2017 at 12:53 US Central Time: This article originally misstated the number of currency pairs globally.

At this price, it was down 33% in the last 24 hours and roughly 68% from its all-time high of $3.84, additional CoinMarketCap.  This took place as the broader digital currency market experienced a notable correction, falling below $600 billion for the first time since January 1. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

 Natural Retracement Digital currencies have had a very strong run over the last few years. Since the start of 2017, their total market capitalization (market cap) has climbed more than 4,500%, rising from roughly $17.7 billion to more than $835 billion earlier this month according to CoinMarketCap. ""The recent decline in cryptos seems to be a simple retracement after the fantastic run we've been having,"" said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, provided similar input, stating that ""This is a natural price correction.""  Regulatory Uncertainty Analysts also singled out regulatory uncertainty as having an adverse effect on market sentiment and therefore helping fuel losses in cryptocurrencies. Many market observers are watching South Korea, which is currently contemplating a ban on digital currency trading, according to The Associated Press (AP). Earlier today, the nation's finance minister told a local radio station that shutting down all cryptocurrency exchanges was certainly an option, although any such action would require thorough review, AP reported. Hayes spoke to the regulatory uncertainty that surrounds digital currency activities in South Korea and other jurisdictions, stating that the resulting ""FUD"" is affecting profit taking. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of data provider CryptoCompare, provided similar input. ""South Korea is one bug bear to most cryptos positive momentum,"" he said.

After that, disregarding minor fluctuations, the XRP market remained steady—even through Coinbase's announcement that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) buying, selling, and trading would be supported on the platform—which dropped the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and many other cryptocurrencies worldwide. 
 According to CoinMarketCap, at 2:24pm Dec. 20, XRP was trading at $0.75779. This morning at 7:04am (Dec. 21), the price was $1.24—marking growth of 64 percent in just 17 hours, and crossing the ""historic"" $1 milestone. The price is currently $1.11.   What you need to know about Ripple (XRP) Ripple operates as a payment network called RippleNet. The goal of the platform is to streamline the transfer of funds—to almost any other currency or cryptocurrency in the world in 4 seconds. Ripple works with banks and financial institutions such as AMEX and the Japan Bank Consortium to become the premier cryptocurrency of record, offering a quick, cost-effective way to transfer funds globally.Continued from page 1 This has huge implications for how we move money across borders.

""XRP was trading at high prices due to the recent news announcements around Ripple's banking partnerships,"" but once the resulting hype began to fade, the cryptocurrency dropped sharply.  Cyclical Price Movements Digital currency trader Marius Rupsys described XRP's pullback differently, emphasizing that ""cryptocurrencies move in cycles,"" and stating that ""Ripple tends to increase in price to very high levels and then just go down for extended period of time.""  Rupsys pointed to a broader correction, stating that ""Not only Ripple but many other cryptocurrencies are going down for the past days.""  Iqbal Gandham, U.K. managing director at eToro, gave a similar point of view, stating that Ripple's recent price decline is ""all part of the general correction,"" stating that XRP is suffering a little more than other currencies because it climbed so sharply.  ""Projects that got high valuations, like Ripple (10x in a month) can't sustain this growth as it is not driven by fundamentals, but rather speculation,"" concluded Rupsys.  Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/01/10/ripple-falls-below-1-75-down-55-from-high/

[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

Milan Koch, managing partner at alphablock, a crypto-asset hedge fund focused on ICOs, offered similar sentiment, asserting that XRP was highly overvalued, and it has been plunging lately because its price was driven up so much by speculation.  ""In general, Ripple has been seeing increased action due to day traders,"" said Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments.  ""Day traders looking to speculate will purchase the lesser valued investment, in this case Ripple, in order to try and leverage it for maximized profits,"" he added.  ""Therefore, lower valued assets are going to have bigger dips and bigger gains.""  Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether. ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/01/16/ripple-falls-below-1-down-75-from-all-time-high/

[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Alongside major developments in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, other altcoins are beginning to gain traction in the broader eye. One such coin is Ripple (XRP), a cryptocurrency known for its connection with the banking world. Disclosure: I own some XRP. 24 hours ago, the price of XRP was $0.27. Earlier this morning (PST), it hit $0.51—an increase of 84 percent. At the time of this writing the price is $0.46 (CoinMarketCap). 
 What you need to know about Ripple Alongside its cryptocurrency, Ripple operates as a payment network called RippleNet. The goal of the platform is to optimize easy transfer of funds—to almost any other currency or cryptocurrency in the world in 4 seconds. Ripple is working with banks and financial institutions to become the premier cryptocurrency of record, offering a quick, cost-effective way to transfer funds globally. For example, if you wanted to send your friend in Italy $50, you could trade for $50 worth of XRP, and they could quickly trade that out for Euros. So why has XRP gone up so quickly? The increased activity in Bitcoin following Cboe launching Bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 10, is generating more activity around the entire cryptocurrency world. As the #4 (and occasionally #5 when Litecoin surpassed it) cryptocurrency, of course Ripple has felt the, well, ripple effect.Continued from page 1 Shutterstock Another explanation is that as the Bitcoin craze cools off, more people are trading for Ripple—which some see as a more stable asset. ""I think that markets view XRP as a very stable digital asset, so they feel safe parking funds in XRP when they exit other assets. If someone wants to get out of BTC, but doesn't want to necessarily move into fiat, he or she moves the value into XRP,"" said Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets at Ripple in an interview with Coindesk. Especially as network speeds lag and transaction fees soar on Bitcoin, Ripple may be an appealing trading alternative with its super-fast speeds. AMEX Partnership 
 Unlike many cryptocurrencies, whose ethos moves away from traditional banking and financial institutions, Ripple seeks to use the new technology to optimize how money is moved. To that end, a recently announced partnership with American Express could be driving buzz around XRP. Ripple will be working with AMEX to ""solve liquidity shortfalls in remittances by offering instant blockchain-based payments."" ""American Express has a long history of integrating new technologies...,” said American Express Chief Information Officer Marc Gordon, in a statement. “This collaboration with Ripple and Santander represents the next step forward on our blockchain journey, evolving the way we move money around the world.” Editor’s Note & Disclosure: The author participates in cryptocurrency markets.

2017-12-22 15:28:00,Ripple,forbes,5 Reasons Why The Ripple (XRP) Price Continues To Surge In The Face Of Crypto Market Corrections,"Shutterstock The XRP price is way higher than it was at the start of the month—even thriving amid yesterday's 20 percent crypto market drop-off—here's why. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] December has been a banner month for XRP, the native asset of Ripple. The first surge took place Dec. 12-13, wherein Ripple leapt 84 percent—from $0.27 to $0.51. In the days that followed, it grew again, finding a resistance barrier around the $0.75 mark. Then, yesterday, Ripple shot for the moon again, surging 64 percent in 17 hours past the $1 milestone, progressing all the way to $1.37. Disclosure: I own some XRP. Pretty astounding for a coin that began December trading at $0.24. A little over a dollar might not immediately sound like a huge change, but that's well over 400 percent growth in one month. Though we witnessed a major drop-off yesterday, wherein the overall cryptocurrency market cap dropped by as much as 20 percent, Ripple has been hit proportionately less than others, remaining above its yesterday mark. 
 So what's causing this explosion in price? Here are 5 reasons. Shutterstock Late-November saw Bitcoin crack $10K, and shortly thereafter the announcements of bitcoin futures trading on Cboe and CME. The attention that ensued—both from the media and mainstream—has been unprecedented in the world cryptocurrency, drawing hordes of newcomers to the space. Many of these newcomers begin their crypto journey on popular brokerage Coinbase (more on this in a minute). For most of December, Coinbase only supported three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC). Of those three, most investment has traditionally poured into BTC and ETH, but early this month, we saw consumers graduate to Litecoin, causing several major jumps, peaking at $390 before coming to rest around $320. Now that Litecoin has hit its initial resistance barrier, the natural impact has been that motivated participants have sought new avenues for investment. This has precipitated wild growth among many different cryptocurrencies, including: TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), QTUM, Verge (XVG), and Reddcoin (RDD), among many others—bringing the overall cryptocurrency market cap to a record high of $611B before the Bitcoin drop-off we saw yesterday, which brought it back to $508B at the time of this writing. As one of the oldest, most established and time-tested cryptocurrencies, it's no surprise that investors turned to it early in their crypto investing.Continued from page 1 American Express Co. chip credit cards are arranged for a photograph in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, Oct. 16, 2017. American Express is expected to release third-quarter earnings figures on October 18. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg As a team of finance, technology and fintech veterans, Ripple has demonstrated a clear understanding that an emphasis on partnerships and customer acquisition is an invaluable way for emerging technology companies to thrive. Ripple now has over 75 commercially deploying customers—and over 100 currently on their roster. But more than just establishing a customer base, Ripple has used strategic partnerships to generate buzz. For instance, the recently announced partnership with American Express was many Americans' first encounter with Ripple—and immediately situated the brand as a reliable financial service, rather than a weird or intimidated new technology. 
   While these efforts have generated organic press, Ripple is also clearly doubling down on its media effort—with coverage ramping up over the past month. More notably, last week the San Francisco company hired Tom Channick, the former corporate communications manager for Facebook's advertising and business integrity unit, as its head of communications. Asia plays a key role in this strategy. As Ken Rapoza pointed out, Asians are ""going mad"" for Ripple. This is not an unfounded claim; last year, Ripple partnered with SBI Holdings to launch SBI Ripple Asia to serve markets in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and ASEAN countries by establishing a dedicated sales and engineering group tasked with selling and installing solutions for cross-border bank payments. ""People feel comfortable with its name and the technology behind Ripple,"" said Trevor Koverko, CEO of Polymath, in an interview with Rapoza. ""A lot of people are beginning to realize how big of an opportunity there is between business and the blockchain...and that's making Ripple the early winner here."" A branded coffee mug is seen at the Coinbase Inc. office in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Friday, Dec. 1, 2017. Coinbase wants to use digital money to reinvent finance. In the company's version of the future, loans, venture capital, money transfers, accounts receivable and stock trading can all be done with electronic currency, using Coinbase instead of banks. Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg The effect of this media boom is a major uptick in rumors that Coinbase will soon support XRP buying, selling, and trading on its platform. The widespread assumption is that if that occurs, a whole new crop of buyers will start investing in XRP. For perspective, Coinbase is adding around 100,000 new users per day and recently surpassing YouTube as the #1 app on the Apple App Store. The recent addition of Bitcoin Cash, which caused a media frenzy on Dec. 19, demonstrates the weight Coinbase holds in cryptocurrency worldwide. Many coins right now are bought and traded based on pure speculation—and there's nothing wrong with that per se; it's how many young altcoins with great ideas will flesh out their networks before they're fully operational. But it also means that those currencies are backed almost exclusively by ideas and public belief in those ideas, which is a dangerous position to be in when something like yesterday's drop comes into play. Positioned as a multi-pronged solution for major financial institutions (which aren't going away any time soon), Ripple is actually a useful product to its customers now—regardless of what it will or will not build in the future—and these customers happen to be some of the biggest financial institutions in the world. And it's speed (4-second transactions) and low fees also make it appealing to general consumers. This is also supported by how Ripple itself functions. XRP is a pre-mined coin, which has drawn criticism for going against the ethos of decentralization and the lack of mining opportunities that creates. Moreover, Ripple retains a full 20 percent of the total supply of XRP. While this too has upset some in the crypto community, it also somewhat immunizes it to the volatility we see in other coins. As Techno Rajji explains in an article written for Oracle Times last month: Due to this limited number of XRP coins, the currency may continue to flourish or at least hold its ground in the future if crypto prices fall. For better or worse, higher supply means lower volatility, and more centralization means more moderation of the market. So, will the current growth rate last? Current market trends indicate that we've touched the nearest resistance barrier after $1 ($1.25). According to Sam Bourgi on Hacked, the next major resistance barrier is $1.50. Taking the past few weeks as an example, we might expect to see a few weeks of trading in the $1.25-$1.35 range to solidify the base before another big jump toward the $1.50 mark. Of course, that's leaving out a sudden event such as a Coinbase announcement or a crypto market correction. On the other hand, in ""The Bear Case For XRP: Bitcoin Futures Edition,"" Kyle Samani makes the case for a less optimistic view, questioning the long-term validity of XRP's use cases against more a established coin like Bitcoin while acknowledging that XRP still might have a substantial amount of growth left: We maintain our position: in the long run, we’re bearish on XRP. We simply don’t see any series of events that can occur that would cause financial institutions to voluntarily adopt XRP over the global reserve. Having said that, given the state of crypto markets today, XRP could keep pumping. There’s really not a good objective valuation model for XRP given the intrinsic velocity problem that it faces, so it could 5x before our thesis is reflected in XRP price movements. Whatever ends up being the case, Ripple has proven itself as one of the most fascinating cryptocurrencies to watch.

[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]  
 As for what caused the digital token to suffer such a sharp decline, analysts pointed to several causes. CoinMarketCap Excludes Korean XRP Prices CoinMarketCap recently decided to exclude XRP prices provided by Korean exchanges from its average price. This move has been credited with causing the digital token to lose roughly $20 billion worth of market capitalization (market cap) around 05:00 UTC today.  Cryptocurrency trader Marius Rupsys emphasized that this move had a ""big impact,"" as the XRP price on Korean exchanges is 50%+ higher than it is on Western exchanges. Profit Taking Other analysts emphasized the strong run the digital token has had lately, noting that it may very well have been time for traders to begin taking profits. A certain amount of this activity was ""inevitable,"" said Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director for eToro. Brad Chun, chief investment officer of hedge fund Shuttle Fund Advisor, also singled out profit taking as a major factor helping push XRP prices lower.  Market Correction Some market observers claimed that XRP was bound to experience a correction, emphasizing how far and how fast its price climbed. ""Ripple's correction was overdue,"" said Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, a subsidiary of 360 BlockChain.  This pullback fit in to a broader trend, he said. ""It was a very good weekend for the altcoins, and today we're seeing corrections across the board.""  Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro, emphasized that after rising more than 1,000% over the last month, a sizable pullback is to be expected.

[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

 One example is the sharp increase XRP experienced roughly mid-December, where it surged more than 90% in 24 hours, reaching roughly $0.87 as investors responded to news that Ripple completed its cryptographic lockup of tokens. The cryptocurrency enjoyed another short rally approximately one week later, climbing to $1.24 as it benefited from sustained momentum and robust Asian trading. XRP's price approached $1.50 earlier this week, pushing higher amid news that Tokyo-based SBI Ripple Asia announced a consortium created to explore how distributed ledger technology could be used for payment cards. Shifting Investor Priorities More recently, analysts have focused on the shifting sentiment of investors, emphasizing that XRP has been benefiting from these changes. Originally, many of those who advocated cryptocurrencies favored these digital assets because of their decentralized nature, said Marius Rupsys, a digital currency trader. These market participants disliked Ripple's centralized nature, opting to trade digital currencies that were decentralized, he stated. However, the digital currency market's size has swelled this year, climbing from roughly $17.7 billion to more than $600 billion this month, CoinMarketCap figures show. According to Rupsys, the new investors that are flooding the market are more interested in the return they might generate than the decentralization and immutability that many Libertarians would value. This has provided significant tailwinds for Ripple, which has in turn risen sharply in price.

Answers by Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, on Quora: Q: What will set XRP apart from other cryptocurrencies? 
 A: What sets XRP apart from the other major digital assets is that XRP is highly performant and optimized for institutional use in global payments. While I’m personally loving BTC and a believer that it’s solving a different use case, the reality is that today the average time to complete a BTC transaction is about four hours. In contrast, XRP is about four seconds. A couple of other similar comparisons important for payments and enabling an Internet of Value: ... Q: What are some things about Blockchain that are just hype? A: Blockchain is like the new big data or AI - too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem. We like to call them Blockchain tourists! There are many applications that are nothing more than science experiments. Some of the uses being implemented for blockchain could actually work better with a database. There are examples out there that blockchain is not most applicable for and that is why Ripple is focused on a real world use case, solving a real (and very large) customer problem, which has converted into commercial traction that is unmatched in the enterprise blockchain space. ... Q: How close are we to XRP being adopted by the banks?Continued from page 1 A: Some of our customers are already in the early stages of using xRapid, Ripple’s XRP liquidity solution. Payments into emerging markets can require multiple currency traders (added costs) and pre-funded local currency accounts in the destination (trapped, dormant capital). Instead, payment providers and banks can use XRP to fund these payments on demand, without intermediaries, at a cost that is less than half of the current cost. But it’s safe to say that we have to crawl before we walk before we run. This is uncharted territory for banks and payment providers and it’s going to take time before you see broad adoption of digital assets solving this multi-trillion dollar opportunity. Suffice it to say, we are very pleased by the interest from various pilots our customers are already running.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token climbed its latest price record today, pushing higher as investors flocked to the digital currency. XRP tokens rose to as much as $1.90 at roughly 11:00 UTC (6:00 a.m.) today, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price level, the digital currency had surged more than 46% over the last 24 hours, additional CoinMarketCap data shows. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] A Practical Investment As for why the digital currency has been drawing interest lately, Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro, emphasized that XRP is a practical investment. 
 ""At the moment, it takes between 2 and 5 business days to transfer funds from one bank to another, whereas Ripple can process these transactions in seconds flat and for a fraction of the cost,"" he stated. Cryptocurrency trader Marius Rupsys offered a similar take on the situation. Rupsys noted that he has spoken with some payment processors, and they are ""pretty excited about the technology as it allows them to offer almost instant settlement and cheaper compared to current bank system.""  Greenspan noted that while investing in many cryptocurrencies represents a departure from the current financial system, ""An investment on Ripple seems to be more level-headed because it's intention is to integrate with the current banking network and make it stronger."" Changing Investor Preferences Rupsys spoke to changing investor preferences, emphasizing that the retail and institutional investors who have been flocking to digital currencies have different priorities from the old guard. He stated that: Crypto community is expanding from early bitcoin adopters to mainstream and institutional investors. Early crypto investors were very much for decentralization, immutability and other libertarian ideas. New crypto participants do not hold same views as they are in crypto for different reasons - mainly financial incentives. Rupsys emphasized that since Ripple is ""centralized technology and pre-mined, therefore many early crypto participants did not like Ripple and would trade it only short term."" However, he said that the newer retail and institutional investors have a different point of view, as they simply ""buy what makes sense."" A Cautionary Note While Ripple's price has been skyrocketing lately, Iqbal Gandham, UK managing director for eToro, provided a cautionary note on these sharp gains. ""What people don't see is that it's success is based on keeping transaction fees low,"" he emphasized.  ""These fees are eventually linked to its price. You cannot have the price rise too much otherwise it's ability to lower the cost of transactions for banks disappears."" Gandham added that ""What that sweet spot is, no one has as yet calculated.""

Shutterstock The price of Ripple's XRP token hit a new record today, adding to the string of all-time highs the digital token has attained this year. XRP rose to as much as $1.43 today, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price, the digital token - which powers the Ripple network - had risen 30% in the last 24 hours, more than 450% in the last month and over 20,000% year-to-date (YTD).

 Today, Tokyo-based SBI Ripple Asia - founded by Ripple and Japanese financial services firm SBI Holdings - announced the creation of a ""consortium"" designed to investigate the role that distributed ledger technology could play in card payments, according to an online translation of a press release.  Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, described this development as the only major news involving Ripple. However, he emphasized that digital currencies have been growing more popular in Japan, a development that may have helped lay the foundation for XRP's latest price gains. ""Ripple is huge in Japan and Japanese interest in crypto currencies in general has skyrocketed (based on trading volume) over the past six months,"" he stated.  Enneking also emphasized that ""It’s also in SBI Ripple’s best interests to hype XRP,"" ""so one must bear that in mind as well.""  Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro, offered a different point of view, asserting that while ""This news of this new consortium does seem to be adding fuel to the fire,"" the latest announcement is only part of what has been driving XRP higher lately.  Ripple's Resilience While some cryptocurrencies experienced notable volatility lately, ""Ripple has been one of the first cryptos to really recover from the Christmas doldrums,"" noted Greenspan.  ""It was well outperforming its peers in the surge leading up to the holidays and had quintupled in a week before the peak on December 22nd,"" he emphasized.  Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, highlighted XRP's value, pointing to ""Its stability and mainstream use cases.""  Even after hitting its recent high of $1.43, ""Ripple is still a buy-and-hold,"" said Koyen.  Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2017/12/27/ripple-rally-continues-pushing-currency-to-latest-all-time-high/
2018-01-03 13:23:00,Ripple,forbes,"I Just Made $3000 Investing In Ripple, And It's A Dangerous Feeling","Shutterstock The other week, gripped by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) and the tantalizing feeling that I could still become super rich if I were to only stop equivocating and make a bet, I bought some cryptocurrency. It felt like millionaires were being minted overnight, and that I could no longer afford not to be one, to be stuck working at a job like a sucker. This was mid-December, when Bitcoin was still rocketing up and nobody really knew what to do with it. I had missed the Bitcoin boat, that much was clear, but like so many others I was determined not to miss the next one. Armed with just enough information to be dangerous, I downloaded Coinbase -- the noob's choice. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] I noticed Litecoin, which had yet to make the sort of leap that Bitcoin had already made. But I was busy that day and didn't get around to it -- Litecoin went from $90 to north of $300 in an instant, another boat missed another bout of FOMO. Determined not to be left behind again, I bit the bullet and made a small bet on Ethereum, and just like that, it doubled too. From one perspective, I was happy -- money for nothing. From another, psychologically powerful perspective, I was frustrated. I didn't see the money I made, I once again saw the money I had missed by not making a much larger bet -- gamblers out there might recognize this feeling. I pressed on, convincing myself I knew what I was doing. 
 From there, so-called ""altcoins"" seemed the obvious choice. Bitcoin was doing well but didn't appear likely to deliver the mind-spinning gains that it had done in the past -- for those you'd have to pick up something less established. I did my research -- the sort of research that takes place primarily in a Google search bar and a few Reddit forums but still qualifies as research -- and I went with Ripple (XRP). Ripple was unpopular with the Redditors for its centralization, but I had the feeling that this current wave of crypto-interest was coming less from the techno-libertarian set that had kicked off Bitcoin and more from institutional and mainstream small investors. It had actual utility for international bank transfers, increasing hints of partnerships with large organizations and rumors about the sort of Coinbase listing that had recently spun Bitcoin Cash into the stratosphere. Ripple came at a low price of just under $1, even if that low price was somewhat deceptive given the massive supply that would necessarily keep it from reaching Bitcoin-like price heights without consuming the entire world's economy. Still, not everyone knows that, and I figured that the low sticker price might entice enough investors like myself to start pumping the thing. Which is just to say: I made a semi-informed decision and placed my chips. I could just have easily been wrong, but it turned out I was right, and my initial investment has doubled. I didn't quite buy it at the price I wanted because an overloaded Coinbase was taking forever to turn US Dollars into the Bitcoin I would need to buy the Ripple -- but I did get in before a giant surge, and that surge continues at the time of this writing. Again there was that feeling, the feeling unmistakable to any gambler that's ridden a high, however short or long. There's the elation of being right as well as the feeling that it isn't quite money for nothing, that you made this money because you are smart and savvy. And because everyone starts with a small bet, that feeling is soon followed by the notion that you should keep playing. And not only keep playing, but play bigger. Had I made twice as big a bet that first time around, after all, I would have made twice as much money. Had I thrown every last dime I have to my name I would have wound up with twice as many dimes. But the ease with which money comes to the gambler, as so many old sayings will tell you, is matched only by the ease with which it leaves. Maybe I would have doubled my life savings, but maybe I'd be broke. Shutterstock We know this on an intellectual level -- that gambling has some serious drawbacks. But that applies to everyone else, and my bet landed. Who's to say my next bet won't land? Or maybe I should go into full day-trading territory, liquidate my Ripple and try to either buy it again at a lower price or throw that cash into something with the potential to double more quickly. It's tempting. Right now, at least for the somewhat-informed investor and perhaps for more investors than would describe themselves that way, cryptocurrencies feel like a roulette wheel with an opaque piece of plastic covering all the numbers. In real roulette there are a bunch of red tiles, a bunch of black tiles, and a single green tile. That green tile isn't included in any of the grouped bets, and it's the key to the game. It means that if you bet on red or black an infinite number of times, you're bound to lose because the odds come in just under 50-50. And because the house is betting an essentially infinite number of times, it means that Casinos can safely place roulette wheels prominently on their floors. In the crypto wheel, however, one gets the feeling that there are more black tiles than red tiles, maybe even many more. Maybe making bets and seeing where they land is actually the correct economic strategy because the odds are better than 50-50. And I think that idea may be right, at least for now. The space feels like it's in expansion, and right now there's money to be made, even if it is indeed a bubble. It's why even nonsense bets on a meme-oriented coin created as a joke could have yielded 90 times your initial investment. But if we play for long enough we might take that cover off and discover that it was really all green tiles and that the house is walking away with all our money. Bitcoin has minted millionaires,  but it's estimated that around 1000 people own 40% of the market. This is even more true with Ripple. The headline states that I've made around $3000 from my bets, which is true and not true. Yes, the value of the cryptocurrency I have purchased has increased by about $3000 since I purchased it. But I don't have that $3000 right now, I just have a bunch of cryptocurrency. I will have made $3000 if and only if I decide to cash it out. But would I be losing money or making money by doing that? And what if I literally just lose all of it, through any number of the dumb ways I might lose access to my store? Questions for another day. For now, I'll let it ride.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token rose more than 60% in the space of 24 hours to attain its latest all-time high, as the digital currency benefited from robust Asian trading activity and sustained momentum. XRP climbed to as much as $1.24 today, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price level, the cryptocurrency had surged 62% over the last 24 hours. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] 'Second Wind' This latest price spike took place when traders latched on to XRP's momentum, creating a ""second wind"" for the currency, according to Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro. 
 The token's latest rally came several days after the cryptocurrency spiked more than 90% in the space of 24 hours, a development attributed to traders' desire to diversify and Ripple's announcement that it had locked up 55 billion XRP tokens. When describing the recent upswing in XRP tokens, Greenspan said the following: ""It's part of this same action we've been seeing for the last few weeks."" ""With the choppy action that's happening in this market, cryptotraders are latching on to momentum."" Asian Influence Robust trading in the Asian markets also helped fuel the sharp increase in XRP, according to CoinMarketCap data. At the time of report, XRP/KRW trading on South Korean exchange Bithumb accounted for more than 25% of all XRP trading volume in the last 24 hours. Further, Korbit and Coinone each accounted for roughly 6% of all XRP/KRW activity on the platform. The outsize influence of South Korean trading is part of a broader trend, emphasized Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of digital currency platform CryptoCompare. Some altcoins have a 25% premium when traded using the South Korean won, he noted. Investors Seek 'Pragmatic Projects' Tokens like XRP could benefit as investors seek out projects that are more practical and can be used currently, said Yazan Barghuthi, project lead at Jibrel Network.  He elaborated, stating: ""I think as investors become more knowledgable and seek higher returns - pragmatic projects that can be implemented today, such as Ripple / XRP, will be preferred over ambitious longer-term projects that won't materialize or bear fruit in the short / medium term.""  Greenspan also spoke to the viability of XRP, saying that: ""As a private blockchain Ripple is seen as one of the most stable cryptocurrencies.""  Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2017/12/21/ripple-prices-surge-60-in-24-hours-hitting-latest-high/

 Earlier this year, Ripple cofounder Chris Larsen was worth as much as $20 billion. Chris Larsen Cofounder, Ripple Crypto Net Worth: $7.5 billion - $8 billion* The richest man in crypto is Chris Larsen, a Stanford M.B.A. and veteran Silicon Valley operator who at the January market peak fleetingly had a fortune of some $20 billion, the bulk of it derived from his 5.2 billion XRP, the token of Ripple, the company he cofounded with Jed McCaleb in 2012 to facilitate international payments for banks using blockchain technology. His company controls 61 billion of the 100 billion XRP in supply. Forbes is calculating his net worth based solely on the XRP he owns personally and the value of his 17% stake in Ripple, against the company's most recent valuation: $410 million. Ripple counts Mitsubishi Financial, Bank of America and Santander among its 100-plus customers. A serial entrepreneur, Larsen, 57, cofounded the online mortgage lender e-Loan, in 1997, and, eight years later, Prosper, the peer-to-peer lender that has been valued at more than $1 billion. He seems to have hit it bigger here, even if XRP is nothing more than a speculation vehicle — and one that's down 65% since the beginning of the year. While Larsen stepped down from the company more than a year ago, he still serves as executive chairman and tells Forbes he's ""100% focused on Ripple and helping the team any way I can."" Given these kind of numbers, he'd be crazy not to.

2013-12-19 10:01:00,Ripple,forbes,Digital Currencies: Misadventures With Bitcoin Rival Ripple (XRP),"***Update: This article has been updated with relevant new information. See below. It would be quite the understatement to assert that digital currencies are growing in popularity. The frenzy surrounding Bitcoin - the preferred currency of libertarians, porn addicts and crack dealers - has sparked a global craze, attracting the attention of techies and speculators, alike. Piggybacking off the Bitcoin furor, other digital currencies have fought to get a piece of the action. One of the more promising ones is called Ripple (XRP), which has raised funds from

 Ventures and, unlike Bitcoin, is uninterested in appealing to humanity's seedier side. Considering that some lucky guy in Norway converted $27 worth of Bitcoins into $886K -- a rather mind-blowing 3. 
 
3M
 percent return on investment -- I figured I might as well try my hand at investing in Ripple. Inconveniently, Ripple Labs doesn't accept cash directly. Instead, you have to use what is referred to as a ""gateway"" - a site that will accept cash and deposit it into your ""Ripple Wallet"" on your behalf... for a nominal fee, of course. 
 As part of Ripple's grand strategy of giving away billions of Ripples to encourage early adopters, the new Seattle-based gateway called SnapSwap was giving away 500 Ripples to anyone who used their service to transfer $10 into a Ripple Wallet. I took them up on their offer, and I received my $10 after a couple of business days. But I never got my 500 Ripple reward. No matter, I thought. It will arrive. So, I sent another $100 to SnapSwap, hoping to eventually exchange the money for Ripples and to claim another 300 Ripple reward. That was on Dec 3rd. Unfortunately, I haven't heard from my money since then. (This has since been resolved. See update below***.) Getting anyone to help has been rather difficult. SnapSwap's customer support line -- in which a gentleman with a heavy Russian accent greets you -- neither answers the phone nor returns voice mail. Their e-mail support isn't much better: I got a response telling me they were busy. Frustrated, I turned to Twitter. I really disliked doing that, but I felt as if I had no other option. I was being ignored. So, I publicly notified them that I hadn't received my money. This sparked an active discussion in which a Twitter account that appears to be associated with Ripple Labs -- but actually is not an official Ripple Labs account (see update below***) admitted wrote that people like me weren't all that important to them:  Apparently, the Ripple philosophy is The message that ""bigger accounts matter more than smaller ones"" is definitely not consumer-friendly advice. I'm pleased to learn, however, that this is not Ripple's philosophy. (See update below***.) Fair enough, I suppose. But I can't imagine that reminding small investors of their irrelevance is a wise strategy for attracting more of them. ***UPDATE: 20-Dec-13, 6:00 a.m. PST.  Since writing this article, I have been contacted by both Ripple Labs and SnapSwap, and I have now received all of my money. I am obviously happy with this outcome, but there are several points worth making. First, the reason my money hadn't appeared in my Ripple Wallet was because SnapSwap had a problem with my account. That is a legitimate excuse, in my opinion, but I should have been contacted. Certainly, 15 days is a long enough period of time for me to have received proper notification. I shouldn't have had to make a public complaint to receive adequate customer service. Second, from a branding perspective, Ripple Labs should be careful with whom it associates. As commenter Seth Hoskins noted, Ripple's reputation will be partially judged by those with whom they conduct business. Currently, SnapSwap is not making them look very good.Continued from page 1 Third, it was brought to my attention that the Twitter account XRP Ripple Helpdesk is not officially affiliated with Ripple Labs. The confusion that the Twitter conversation created prompted Ripple to request that the user make clear that he operates independently of Ripple Labs. The user has complied and appears legitimately interested in helping new Ripple customers. However, he should be mindful of how his interactions with others -- even well-intended ones -- impact Ripple and its reputation. Finally, better lines of communication between Ripple Labs, its gateways and its customers needs to be established in short order. Scaling up business quickly can be difficult, but it's necessary in order to prevent customer frustration.

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token declined today, outpacing the losses suffered by many other digital currencies. The price of XRP fell to as little as $1.17, a roughly 18% decline from its daily high of $1.43, CoinMarketCap figures show. At the time of report, the digital token had bounced back somewhat, trading at $1.212, but had still fallen more than any other top 10 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. XRP experienced these losses as the broader digital currency market also moved lower, its total market capitalization (market cap) falling more than 13% between its daily high and low, additional CoinMarketCap data reveals. [Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Wary Investor Sentiment 
 Several analysts pointed to nervous investors when explaining why cryptocurrencies were pushing lower today. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital, spoke to this trader sentiment. ""With the massive dip we saw last week, it's likely that investors who were shaken by the volatility - but smart enough not to sell at the bottom - are simply taking their profits while they can, or pulling out while they're breaking even."" Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments, offered similar input.  ""With the stock market continuing to rise and the government shutdown happening, there is more uncertainty in terms of investment,"" he said.  ""Investors are looking to shy away from crypto, as it comes with less certainty, and invest in options they are more confident in perusing due to familiarity.""  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of data provider CryptoCompare, emphasized that the markets are ""still shaky"" because investors are ""skittish."" Ripple's Decline Ripple's XRP token has fallen more than the broader cryptocurrency markets because there is significant uncertainty surrounding the digital asset, said analysts. ""Ripple is definitely trying to find its equilibrium after the meteoric growth it experienced in 2017,"" said DiPasquale.  ""The market still isn't certain what the true valuation of XRP is, based on the role it plays in the larger Ripple infrastructure. Also, people have been holding Ripple since it was pennies, so the growth is intense and we have to remember the bigger picture of its immense growth these year.""  Collin Plume, president of Noble Alternative Investments, also emphasized that the market is having a difficult time determining XRP's price. He said: Ripple has not recovered in short-term pricing since Coinbase dispelled the rumors that it was going to be the next coin on the platform.  In a normal market this coin would have stabilized with the announcement of the partnership with MoneyGram. Ripple will continue to be a volatile coin until the effects of the MoneyGram partnership are established.   Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether. ",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/01/22/ripple-drops-as-nervous-investors-flee-cryptocurrencies/

Shutterstock Ripple's XRP token has risen sharply in the last few days, climbing almost 90% in the space of 24 hours after suffering a steep decline. The digital token rose to as much as $1.71 today, according to CoinMarketCap. At this price, XRP was up roughly 88% over the space of 24 hours, additional CoinMarketCap figures show. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Ripple's Roller Coaster Ripple's XRP token has been on a roller coaster the last few weeks, climbing to an all-time high of $3.84 earlier this month. 
 While this sharp rise generated many headlines, the digital asset soon went in to a free fall, which resulted in its price falling below $1 on January 16 and quickly reaching a local low of $0.898, CoinMarketCap data shows. Speculative Nature Several analysts have pointed to XRP's speculative nature when explaining why the digital asset's price has been so volatile. ""Ripple is certainly a highly speculative asset,"" said Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of data provider CryptoCompare.  Because the digital currency is driven largely by speculation, it makes XRP highly sensitive to brief changes in sentiment, stated Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management.  XRP's markets are ""less developed,"" meaning that it has less liquidity than Bitcoin, said Hayter. As a result, ""it takes less trading volume to move XRP,"" he said. In other words, XRP's low trading volume makes it more vulnerable to market manipulation.  Natural Bounce Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, took a different tack, describing XRP's recent recovery as a natural bounce following sharp losses.  Ripple was ""one of the most damaged altcoins during the latest rout,"" he emphasized. ""It is only natural that it rebounds aggressively.""

Charles Thorngren, CEO of Noble Alternative Investments, offered a similar point of view, stating that ""XRP is seeing a sell-off from the latest news out of China. Cryptocurrency Market 'Being Battered' At this point, the market is being fueled by fear, said Hayter. ""The entire crypto market is being battered,"" said Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA.  However, he emphasized that digital currencies are not the only asset class that is in the red, as stocks have also been experiencing a sell-off. While some analysts pointed to the recent weakness in cryptocurrencies, others emphasized that these price fluctuations could simply be the typical rise and fall of market prices.

Shutterstock The XRP token surged earlier today, after Ripple and MoneyGram announced that had partnered so the latter firm could test out using the XRP token. The digital currency spiked close to 30% in an hour, rising from $1.75 to $2.25, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of report, XRP had surrendered much of these gains, trading at $1.95, additional CoinMarketCap data showed. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

 ""Ripple had earlier announced that they have struck deals with 3 of the 5 biggest payment processors in the world,"" he noted.  ""Until now the market was treating this as just another rumor,"" said Greenspan.  ""So the announcement today not only delivered good news it also left the taste of anticipation that they may be delivering on their full promise.""  Ripple's 'Strong Partnerships' Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital, also provided positive commentary surrounding the announcement. ""MoneyGram is the latest example of Ripple's masterful cadence of announcements of deals with large companies,"" he said. ""Every time Ripple announces a partnership, we see an increase in value.""  DiPasquale stated that ""If Ripple's strong partnerships continue, I expect its value to continue to increase.""  Market Dynamics While the aforementioned analysts cited the MoneyGram announcement as fueling Ripple, recent increase, some market observers pointed to other factors. Ripple suffered a sharp decline recently, which brought it to as little as $1.62 earlier today, a more than 50% decline from its all-time high of $3.84, additional CoinMarketCap shows. Tim Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, described Ripple's recent run up as being ""Just a recovery from a dramatic selloff.""  Ripple Gains Steam Oliver Isaacs, cryptocurrency investor and influencer, stated that Ripple is ""gaining momentum"" on its way back to $3 and eventually $4.  He spoke to the digital currency's growing visibility, stating: ""Ripple has over the past month been gaining mainstream attention from the press and investors a like, not to mention numerous Reddit sub threads, coin aggregation sites and Telegram groups, which has contributed to the strong price action.""  ""Every cryptocurrency investor and hedge fund I have spoken to have asked me about Ripple's potential in the market,"" added Isaacs.  Disclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/01/11/ripple-spikes-as-moneygram-announcement-boosts-confidence/

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News Ripple prices have surged in the last few days, building upon their recent gains to rally more than 90% over the last 24 hours. The price of XRP tokens has climbed to as much as $0.8661, according to CoinMarketCap. By reaching this level, the digital currency has risen roughly 91.9% in the space of 24 hours and upwards of 300% from the weekly low of $0.2222 it reached on December 8, additional CoinMarketCap figures show. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Many of the major digital currencies - including Litecoin, Ether and Bitcoin - have generated compelling gains this year as the digital currency market surged higher. 
 However, Ripple's year-to-date (YTD) increase of more than 11,000% takes the cake. As for what has caused Ripple's price to surge lately, analysts pointed to a few factors. Investors Seek Diversification Several market observers asserted that Ripple's XRP tokens have been pushing higher as investors seek to diversify their portfolios with alternative protocol assets or ""altcoins."" Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA, a subsidiary of 360 BlockChain, agreed with this point of view. As mainstream investors rush into crypto, they're looking for bitcoin alternatives — either as a hedge or because bitcoin appears overbought. Litecoin lit up first, then it was Ethereum. These shoppers are working their way down the top-10, looking for safe, familiar names. Ripple fits the bill perfectly. Yazan Barghuthi, project lead at Jibrel Network, offered similar input, stating that the major altcoins have been positioning themselves to draw investment when Bitcoin suffers an inevitable correction. Crypto Lockup Some analysts pointed to Ripple's recent announcement that it completed the cryptographic lockup of XRP tokens that it had promised to do earlier this year. In May, the company revealed plans to place 55 billion XRP tokens in a cryptographically-secured escrow account in order to help ensure the stability of total supply. Ripple revealed that it plans to create 55 smart contracts that will hold 1 billion XRP each. Every month, one of these contracts will expire, making the associated digital tokens available for use. Barghuthi asserted that XRP has gained as investors responded to this news.  ""Ripple recently locked up a large amount of their unfrozen token supply in smart contracts,"" he emphasized. ""While the lock up had implications on price, it is more likely that the uptick in price is the market reacting to this move."" Sean Walsh, a partner at Redwood City Ventures, also spoke to the key role played by this move: In our opinion, there is just one factor responsible for Ripple's recent rise. It is Ripple's Dec 7 followthrough on their May 2017 promise of locking 55 Billion XRP into a time-release escrow. This is over half of their total token supply. This step instantly nullified a key criticism of their network. The first of the six fundamental characteristics of money is that it should be Scarce (SDDRFT).

For obvious reasons: rising government regulations, hacking and the tightening of liquidity by major banks — to mention a few. But with many currencies trading anywhere from 60% to 80% below their all-time highs, and the advance/decline ratio improving, the time may be ripe to go bargain hunting.

If you end up picking up falling angels: assets with weak fundamentals that are unable to survive the market turmoil, and are crashing back to earth. How can you separate fallen from falling angels? That’s certainly a difficult task for a couple of reasons. One of them is psychology. Most investors would find it hard to rise over the gloom and doom of the present and look over the hills of the future. Another reason is the lack of sufficient information to evaluate the intrinsic value of an asset; and determine whether it’s undervalued or overvalued at current market price. That’s particularly the case when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Because there are hardly any “fundamental” metrics to appraise the “intrinsic” value of each coin, as is the case with conventional assets. Still there’s behavioral finance and technical analysis that provide a few tips to the daring souls ready to sift through the cryptocurrency maze for lucky coins—“fallen angels.” Still, investing on rather than fundamentals is an extremely risky game for very aggressive investors who are prepared to lose a great of money in a short period of time.

2018-01-11 11:35:00,Ripple,forbes,"For Ripple, MoneyGram Deal Trumps Talks Of South Korea's Crypto Ban","Ripple coin lives another day. (Shutterstock) Once again, another Asian nation is no match for the blockchain. South Korea's talk of banning cryptocurrency trading sent all of the top traded coins down yesterday and again on Thursday. But one major stands out today, and that's Ripple (XRP). The token tied to the digital payments startup is back trading over $2 thanks to an announced deal with Dallas-based MoneyGram. MoneyGram shares rose over 6% on the news. MoneyGram will allow their customers to send and complete cross-border payments with the XRP token instead of fiat currencies like the dollar. MoneyGram will use the company's xRapid, Ripple’s on-demand liquidity product, Ripple said today.  The system permits real-time foreign exchange settlement through ripple coin, ""which gives financial institutions the ability to unlock liquidity and access multiple corridors with one pre-funded originating account."" 
 Ripple has been rising from a small, relatively unknown cryptocurrency to a top-three behind heavyweights bitcoin and ether. Major venture capital firms and banks have invested in the company, including Google Ventures and Standard Chartered bank. This week, word that the South Korean government would ban trading sent ripples through the crypto market. South Korea, Japan and China account for the lion's share of trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. Demand for cryptocurrency has grown so fast, top exchanges like Bitstamp and Okex are closed to new accounts.  The Korean government still seems noncommittal to the idea of the outright ban of exchanges, something China did late last year. Cryptocurrencies fever is rampant in South Korea. Demand tends to push prices of many tokens nearly 30%  higher than they are on exchanges in other countries, leading to arbitrage purchases by risk-taking locals. The country’s Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said the decision to curb trading is multi-departmental, including members of the Finance Ministry and securities regulators. “There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,” Sang-Ki was quoted saying in Reuters. Asia headlines have been a mixed blessing for MoneyGram. The company made headlines this month following a failed China acquisition. Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group Holding. His company, Ant Financial, was banned from acquiring Texas-based MoneyGram International this month. Now, in a very different type of deal, MoneyGram is partnering with Ripple, a company whose cryptocurrency may end up being banned from South Korea's cryptocurrency exchanges. (Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) The company's attempt to sell to China's Ant Financial, a unit of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant founded by billionaire Jack Ma, was banned just last week by the U.S. government.  MoneyGram said it was unable to obtain the required approval for the transaction from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. ""The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,” MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said in a statement. “Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger. We are disappointed in the termination of this compelling transaction,” he said. MoneyGram is a popular service in emerging markets like China and Brazil, where expats often use it to repatriate cash to family members back home or to pay bills. They can now do so in XRP. This week, two Goldman Sachs economists issued a report titled ""Bitcoin as Money"" arguing that cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin, were more apt to be used as a source of payment in weak currency nations where dollars are scarce. Ripple rose to fame after it announced a pilot program signed between two South Korean banks and a consortium of 61 Japanese banks. It's been on a tear ever since. South Korea pulled a rug out from under it this week, but the MoneyGram news kept it from falling further. That might not hold. Seoul is preparing a bill which will ban all cryptocurrencies from trading on local exchanges. It is unclear how this would impact Ripple's pilot project. The company was unavailable for immediate comment. ""Banning cryptocurrencies altogether would be difficult given that the country is one of the biggest markets in the world, especially for bitcoin and ethereum,"" says Forbes contributor Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist for ThinkMarkets in London. ""Keep in mind that this is not the first time that the regulators have gone after the cryptocurrency market.  During this week alone, we have seen two headlines emerging from South Korea aimed at bitcoin. There is no doubt that the demand for bitcoin in South Korea is massive and some elements of the public's behavior — when it comes to trading the cryptocurrencies — aren’t far from gambling habits."" Traders should not read too much into the South Korean situation, Aslam wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Once the bill is drafted, it would require a backing of 297 members of the National Assembly, a process which could take months or even years. ""Ripple's growth over the past year has been stellar and it has acquired multiple institutional customers who are seriously considering using it for cross-border settlements,"" says Abhishek Pitti, founder of Nucleus.Vision, a visual data company using blockchain technology based in Palo Alto and Hyderabad, India. Mumbai-based Reliance Capital serves as both an advisor and early investor to the company. Draper Ventures founder Tim Draper is also a lead investor in Pitti's company. ""Ripple has shown that they can facilitate double-digit million dollars worth of transactions in seconds, at a fraction of the cost of a bitcoin transaction,"" he says. Pitti thinks XRP will escape South Korea's crypto ban. ""I don't think South Korea is banning cryptocurrencies altogether,"" he says. ""They are clamping down on unregulated exchanges so that shouldn't effect ripple because their primary users are regulated financial institutions.""

2017-08-16 11:09:00,Ripple,forbes,Ripple Uses Blockchain To Move Money Faster Than A Flying Courier,"Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, likes to compare speeds of moving money internationally. “If I want to move money from here (San Francisco) to London, the fastest way is to fly there,” he said. “We can stream video from the space station, but I can’t move my own money from A to B, especially for international payments, but that is also true for domestic transfers.” The challenge Ripple is working on is how to use blockchain, or distributed ledger, technology to improve the efficiency, speed and cost of payments. “For anyone in payments, from Visa to SWIFT or Square, the landscape will change as we see friction reduced, and the future will arrive sooner than we think.” Blockchain technologies are compelling in a lot of ways, Garlinghouse added, but a lot of people are all over the map with blockchain ideas, making it look like a technology in search of a problem. 
 Ripple is focused on real world use cases, understanding the real value proposition to banks and customers. Santander's POC experience Last year Santander launched a pilot to use Ripple for international payments in 19 European countries and the U.S., said Ed Metzger, head of technology innovation at Santander in the UK. Santander Innoventures, the bank’s venture capital arm, had made an investment in Ripple, he added.Continued from page 1 “In our pilot we enable staff to send money to any bank in 20 geographies by sending a payment via Ripple and then using a partner in each destination to complete the last mile to the end bank account,” he explained. “International payments only work if you can get the money to where you want it to go. This will greatly improve Santander's internal transfers, but it’s important to be able to send to any bank. With the current setup we were able to get to money to customer accounts the next day. Blockchain for international payments opens up the possibility for instant payments, but as first step we have improved the service to go from multiple days down to next day at the latest.” For Santander, a key issue was finding a solution that worked today and could make a difference to customers today. It developed a mobile app to connect to Ripple. “It’s been very successful; we have very positive feedback from staff members who have used it.” They liked the certainty of when the payment would arrive, which they said was superior to the experience with SWIFT for international payments. “Ripple gives certainty as to when the money would arrive and how much would arrive. If you want 100 euros to arrive, you want to make sure you send exactly the right amount of money to cover any fees taken,  and with SWIFT that is sometimes challenging.” 
 Ripple and its digital asset, XRP While Ripple doesn't rely on bitcoin, it does use its own digital asset, XRP.  (For a discussion of XRP and a look at Hyperledger as an alternative, see the analysis from the  from the pseudonymous P4man at coindesk.) Comparing bitcoin to Napster as an early player that demonstrated the digital aspect of music and proved the technology but didn’t win, Garlinghouse said bitcoin may prove to be a better store of value than a medium for transaction — its average transaction time is over 10 hours at a cost of more than $1, he said, while Ripple can process a transaction in three to four seconds for a fraction of a penny. (Bitcoin’s price has risen above $4,000, more than doubling in the last month, according to coindesk.) Garlinghouse thinks the cross-border payment business is ripe for change. “Do we really think in 10 years out global trans-border payments will take days to settle, built on a system designed in the ‘70s?”Continued from page 2 Ripple will be at Sibos, the annual SWIFT operations conference, he said, and the company has found a growing audience. “They are believers. They think we have been stuck in decades old technology long enough and they would like to see the marketplace move forward.” Ripple provides customers with settlement in three to four seconds with two-way messaging so a user can see that an account number matches the intended recipient. The messaging also shows when a payment has arrived at its destination. The information drives down error rates, he said. Unlike Currency Cloud and TransferWise which aim at companies and consumers, Ripple works with banks, which he described as repositories of value. Ripple now has 75 customers and around 20 have announced their first product use cases, while others are in stage of deployment, he added. For a Ripple bank user to reach a user at a bank that is not a Ripple, banks can work with payment service providers like Earthport, he said. The existing model of correspondent banking has its problems. The number of correspondent banks around the world  dropped by roughly 50 percent over the last 15 years, said Garlinghouse, from 28,000 to about 12,000 The cost of supporting correspondent banking has increased with regulatory compliance and the cost of capital.

2017-09-08 19:49:00,Ripple,forbes,Blockchain Enterprise Firms R3 And Ripple Sue Each Other Over $1 Billion Of Cryptocurrency,"As blockchain companies have lost the spotlight this year to the burgeoning, hot world of crypto assets, two of the enterprise blockchain leaders, R3 and Ripple, are now embroiled in a dispute over the cryptocurrency XRP. On Friday, in the Delaware Chancery Court, R3, a consortium of more than 80 financial institutions across the world, sued its partner Ripple, over an options contract to buy more than $1 billion worth of XRP. The same day, in a California state court in San Francisco, Ripple countersued. R3 says in its lawsuit that in September 2016, the companies entered into an agreement, part of which gave R3 the option to purchase 5 billion XRP at an exercise price of $0.0085 between then and September 2019. After soaring more than 3,000% this year, XRP now trades at more than $0.20, making the options worth more than $1 billion. Shutterstock 
 San Francisco-based Ripple uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to make international wire transfers and other forms of cross-border exchange faster and cheaper. New York-based R3 uses similar technology, a distributed ledger which does not use cryptocurrency, as well as its consortium of financial institutions to make multiple banking functions more efficient. The R3 suit claims that, in June 2017, Ripple's current CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emailed R3 CEO David Rutter to terminate the option contracts and asks the court to reinstate the rights granted in it. In its suit, Ripple claims that R3 misled Ripple into entering into partnership agreements, signed in 2016, in which Ripple would benefit from R3's banking partnerships, while R3 would gain not only from the options but also a share of 15% of the revenue Ripple received from any bank participating in their commercial partnership. It alleges that after signing, R3 instead focused its efforts on fundraising. (In May of this year, R3 announced it raised $107 million.) Ripple also alleges that, prior to signing, R3 touted the membership of partners like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who left the consortium after the contract with Ripple was signed. It asks that the court invalidate its agreements and for R3 to pay damages from the breach of its agreement with Ripple in an amount to be determined at trial. “R3 does not discuss the details of pending litigation. We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter,” said R3 in a written statement. A Ripple spokesperson wrote, ""Our filing is straightforward -- R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP’s ~4000% increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement."" R3 has raised $107 million from its consortium banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, HSBC, and Wells Fargo. Ripple has raised $94 million from Andreessen Horowitz, IDG Capital Partners, Santander Innoventures, SBI Investment, Seagate Technology and others. The market capitalization or network value of XRP has skyrocketed this year from $236 million to $8 billion as of Friday. Ripple is believed to own about 60% of XRP in existence.

The payments system company uses blockchain technology and has its own digital token to allow for users to pay for its services. Japan and South Korea are running a pilot program using their system, known as RippleNet. (Shutterstock image) The Asians have discovered a new cryptocurrency you've probably never heard of. Ripple (XRP), a top five cryptocurrency with a whopping $46.2 billion market cap, is up 57.2% on Thursday, beating every major crypto coin out there and surpassing $1 for the first time, based on Coin Market Cap data. ""Asians are going mad for Ripple,"" says Alexey Ivanov, CEO and co-founder of Polynom Crypto Capital, a Moscow-based cryptocurrency and blockchain investment fund manager. Today's price gains are largely driven by Asian crypto gamblers. Ripple has seen trading volumes increase over the last 24 hours by nearly 25% at South Korean exchange Bithumb and 10% on Bitfinex in Hong Kong. Ripple is like a Western Union using blockchain technology. It is a digital payment system that allows for discounts for its service for those who pay to use it in the Ripple coin. The company is run by CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has held senior executive positions at AOL and Yahoo! between 2003 and 2012. The company said last week that a coalition of 61 banks in Japan, organized by SBI Ripple Asia in Tokyo, will launch a new digital payments systems pilot program with Woori Bank and Shinhan Bank of South Korea using the Ripple blockchain network. 
 ""People feel comfortable with its name and the technology behind Ripple,"" says Trevor Koverko, CEO of Polymath, a blockchain platform for startups looking to launch their own cryptocurrencies. ""A lot of people are beginning to realize how big of an opportunity there is between business and the blockchain...and that's making Ripple the early winner here."" See: Bitcoin Prices Might Have Peaked, But Smaller Cryptos Have Not -- Forbes Cryptocurrency investors believe that Asia accounts for at least a third of all cryptocurrency trading volume, with the main adopters coming from Japan, South Korea and China via Hong Kong. While Ripple has a service, its large valuation is dependent on that service actually becoming a payments system companies will want to use. Nearly all startups issuing their own cryptocurrencies are massively overvalued, but investors are pouring into these new coins anyway. Those who are not worried about losing all of their investment capital believe they have nothing but upside once they get over the fact that their investment may become worthless. For those with serious money to burn, the upside is hard to ignore. Investors who put $15 to work to buy just one bitcoin in Dec. 2012 now have over $15,000. Investors believe that if they put the same amount of money into ripple, or other lower priced coins, they might get a similar outcome. For traditional investors, none of this makes much sense, but in these early innings of the bitcoin hype, fundamentals don't matter. ""The entire cryptocurrency industry is exploding and ripple has done a great job positioning itself as one of the key entry points for institutional investors,"" says Rob Viglione, one of the founders behind ZenCash, yet another blockchain infrastructure company geared up towards encrypted, anonymous financial transactions. Investors in these companies have to be prepared to lose their entire investment. ""Ripple started the year worth about one cent and is now at a dollar because of banks in Japan and South Korea testing the use of Ripple's technology for flash-transactions,"" says Ivanov. He does not hold XRP in any of his five blockchain-focused funds. Japan and South Korean banks are expected to start test driving RippleNet in the first quarter. Ripple's San Francisco office was not yet open for immediate comment. The coin will primarily be used or institutions and not for retail transactions like Western Union or PayPal.

Discount on gasoline and other products for all holders of the XOM coin. Until that exists, or until it takes billions of shares off market, the big three cryptocurrencies are set to maintain a healthy pace ahead of America's largest oil company in terms of market capitalization. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) The three largest cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum — now have a combined market capitalization larger than all of Exxon. That means more money is pumping in and out of these three invisible assets than into a stock that has billions more shares out there. So here we have a multinational company with bona fide hard assets and prime real estate, a company that controls a commodity needed to heat homes and keep the lights on with a lower market cap than three entities less than 10 years old. A company's market cap is not a measure of the company's value. Market capitalization is the number of shares outstanding times the stock price. Exxon has over 4 billion shares outstanding as of September. By comparison, bitcoin has only 16.7 million coins in circulation. Ethereum's coin, ether, has 96.7 million.  Ripple has many billions of coins, around 30 billion. So if this coin keeps increasing in value, it will surpass bitcoin due to the sheer number of coins there are available to investors. The coin is worth a little over $2. Two weeks ago it was worth less than $1. Nevertheless, while not a measure of a company's success, financial pundits pay a lot of attention to market cap. Each earnings season, hosts on financial news programs try to guess when Apple becomes the world's first trillion-dollar company.  Their market cap is $878 million. 
 Further south, one of the stars of Brazil's economy, Petrobras, saw its market cap collapse from 2008, when it was nearly $100 billion. It's now worth $67 billion. Ripple (XRP) market cap is $20 billion larger than Petrobras. In fact, there is currently no company in Brazil that has a market cap larger than ripple or ethereum. Bitcoin is more than two times larger by market cap than Itau, Brazil's largest corporation. Bitcoin, Ripple, Etherum Vs.

There was a moment, the other week when it felt like I did, and I wrote about it here. I had made the plunge into cryptocurrency after much hemming, a deal of hawing and a couple of agonizing days watching the price fluctuate as Coinbase chugged my USD into ETH. My first bet on Ripple (XRP) paid off handsomely, though not so handsomely as it would have had I been able to buy it when I wanted to. A subsequent bet on Tron (TRX), worked out even better, and for a moment it even seemed like I had been able to staunch the bleed off of a Ripple peak by moving those coins into Tron -- a successful trade from the successful investor, clearly. You can see where this is going. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] Prices collapsed, both across the board but moreso for my coins in particular. The Coinbase coins -- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin -- haven't been hit as hard as the smaller coins, and Ethereum, in particular, is still up overall. But the altcoins are getting hammered, and where there once was money now there is not. Perhaps there never was. The reasons are various: South Korea is considering getting aggressive about regulating cryptocurrencies, and the entire market is suffering as a result. South Korean traders, for a time, seemed to be responsible for the atmospheric rise in Ripple, after all. And then there are the cracks: Ripple is a promising idea for transferring funds, but the reality of it is that there's no reason why banks or businesses would have to use the XRP coin to take advantage of the Ripple platform. Tron was accused of plagiarism and had largely risen on market momentum and obscure promises: the traders left once they realized incredible gains. In a general sense the market got oversold, people took profits and an adjustment was made. No asset can quintuple in value every week. 
 And yet sitting here in midst of a major selloff offers a fascinating glimpse into the mindset of the crypto community. The Reddit communities for Tron and Ripple are as unconcerned right now as they were last week: prices will stabilize at some point, they say, and they'll be back. To many, the price collapse isn't a reason to despair but a reason to rejoice -- it's just a sale on coins. It's time to load up, wait out the saps and return stronger than ever. I don't know when these people bought their Ripple but it's possible that many are still up several multiples despite the recent collapse, and so they may know something I don't. To all the believers out there RT !!!! Let's hold and kill the Whales !! $TRON $TRX Spread the WORD!! We are not giving you our coins!!! #HODL #HODLgang RT RT RT !!! #TRON #TRX pic.twitter.com/818thPwQuU — Paparazzi Stocks (@PaparazziStocks) January 12, 2018 People point to Bitcoin and to Ethereum -- coins that doubtless had their cycles of bubble and bust but always came back, coins that have now delivered massive returns for those investors with the foresight to tough out the lean times. It's a philosophy called HODL, an appropriately meme-oriented investment strategy. Some would call it an acronym -- Hold On for Dear Life -- while others would just call it a drunken misspelling of ""hold"" from an old forum post. Regular investors would just call it being long on a stock, but the crypto world has no time for such arcane phraseology. It's the idea that the price will go up, even if already went down. It's the idea that noobs are the ones who panic and sell, but seasoned crpyto investors double down. For some, HODL is a researched position, for others it feels like more of a philosophical stance akin to the power of positive thinking.  For a long time, at least for a number of coins, HODL has been a sound strategy. The space has grown in fits and starts, but it has grown. There's no guarantee that it will keep doing so in the future. And this is where things get dangerous. I believed these coins would succeed two weeks ago: am I really so fickle? And if I haven't stopped believing, why aren't I pouring more money into the market and snapping up the cheap coins before the price skyrockets again. It was just last week I was doing calculations on what price TRX would need to hit for me to make X amount of money: here's an opportunity to bring that price way down. I gave myself a limit on how much I would invest, but are these the thoughts of a sucker? Or are they the last gasp of a rational brain resisting being totally overtaken by a sucker? It turns out that the mind games a selloff plays with you are no different than the mind games a bubble plays with you. Lurking in the middle of all of this is the notion that you are not a leaf on the wind but rather a savvy operator who can best the market trends through grit and guile. There was a sequence of decisions that could have made this all work, after all. I could have recognized the bubble when it happened and moved all of my assets into USDT, a currency meant to stick as close to $1 a coin as possible. Or I could have bought Ethereum, which was going up when other things were crashing. Then I could move back into Tron and Ripple once they hit bottom, losing nothing in real value but tripling or quadrupling my crypto holdings. I had an inkling the price was cresting, after all, and perhaps next time I can just trust that instinct and make each right move at each right time. Perhaps next time that instinct will be dead wrong. I'll hold, though I'm not sure I'm HODL, at least not like those other guys. I always told myself I was making bets and seeing how they'd land: it's the same whether they're down or up. The headline states that I lost $3,000 on Ripple and Tron, which is true and not true -- just like it was when I had made that money. I still have a bunch of cryptocurrency, not USD, and it's still anyone's guess how much it's worth. If only I could stop refreshing that price.

It seems that cryptocurrency markets were in a bubble ripe to burst. [Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.] Still, big banks may have something to do with both helping the bubble blow bigger and making the burst worse than it could have been. There was a time when Wall Street and big banks provided a tailwind for Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. That was back in the last quarter of 2017, when Wall Street began to recognize Bitcoin as an investment, and was creating the vehicles and mechanisms for broader market participation in it. Like the introduction of Bitcoin futures by CME.Continued from page 1 Meanwhile, big banks provided the liquidity for such broad participation by allowing investors to use their credit cards to pay for cryptocurrency purchases – and help the cryptocurrency bubble grow bigger and bigger. How many investors have used their credit cards to buy Bitcoin? 18.15%. That’s according to a recently released LendEDU Bitcoin investor survey. Most notably, 22.13% of those investors who used credit cards to fund their Bitcoin purchases didn’t pay off their credit card balance after purchasing Bitcoin. Now, big banks are cutting off liquidity to the cryptocurrency markets, when they need it the most; and, perhaps, turning a cryptocurrency correction into a crash. Matthew Schutte, Director of Communications, Holo doesn’t see things that way. ""No collusion amidst Wall Street firms or Banks was needed to pop the Bitcoin bubble. Of course, it didn't help either when research reports surfaced pointing out that there was little chance that Bitcoin will replace money for ordinary exchanges thanks to transaction fees in the tens of dollars and settlement times that work fine... for anybody willing to watch a Netflix show while waiting for their payment to go through."" To be fair, banks have a legitimate concern regarding the ability of cryptocurrency investors to pay their credit card balances after the big fall in cryptocurrency prices. But they shouldn’t have lent money to investors to purchase such high-risk assets in the first place and make the bubble worse than it might have been.

A sell-off that began in Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin  and other cryptocurrencies earlier in the week eventually spread to stocks by the end of the week — see tables. Table 1 Seven-Day Price Change For Major Cryptocurrencies 
 Source: Coinmarketcap.com 2/1/18 at 4:30 p.m. Table 2 Apparently, investors have been getting nervous about every asset class, though for different reasons for each. Cryptocurrency investors have been getting nervous over the future of digital money, as big governments and big banks from China to South Korea and the U.S. are trying to set the rules of the game on their own terms. Then there’s the issue of an ever-growing supply of digital currencies, which has approached the 1400-mark, causing both market “dilution” and confusion. And there’s the issue of trust. Most of these digital currencies have no fundamentals behind them, other than a web page that promises to make capitalism efficient; and there’s the potential of fraud that further undermines that trust.Continued from page 1 Equity investors have been getting nervous about equities for a couple of reasons, too. One of them is market valuations, which are getting overstretched by historical levels. Then there’s the fear that free money is coming to an end. The 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond is moving close to 3%, as the corresponding European and Japanese Treasuries have been heading north, too. Meanwhile, a strong payroll report published by the U.S. government on Friday morning makes it more likely that interest rates will continue to climb in the near future. “Once again, this is ‘good news’ for workers, but it hints that wage inflation is taking hold, and that can be ‘bad news’ for the stock market,” says Ken Berman, market strategist at Gorilla Trades. “It gives the Federal Reserve a ‘green light’ on more rate hikes this year, and that historically makes the stock market nervous.” And there’s the growing government deficit, which will force the U.S. Treasury to issue more Treasury bonds to pay for it. 
 That would certainly put further pressure on long-term interest rates, equities, and possibly cryptocurrencies, too.

2018-02-07 20:04:00,Ripple,forbes,"Time To Go Bargain Hunting In Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin And Other Cryptocurrencies?","(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Cryptocurrency markets have been in a sharp and broad correction recently, which has turned into a crash for most listed currencies. For obvious reasons: rising government regulations, hacking and the tightening of liquidity by major banks — to mention a few. But with many currencies trading anywhere from 60% to 80% below their all-time highs, and the advance/decline ratio improving, the time may be ripe to go bargain hunting.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any cryptocoins or tokens.] Bargain hunting in assets that have been sold off by fleeing investors can make you a great deal of money — provided that you pick up the fallen angels: assets with strong fundamentals that have the potential to survive the market storm and rise again. Bargain hunting can lose you plenty of money, too. If you end up picking up falling angels: assets with weak fundamentals that are unable to survive the market turmoil, and are crashing back to earth. How can you separate fallen from falling angels? That’s certainly a difficult task for a couple of reasons. One of them is psychology. Most investors would find it hard to rise over the gloom and doom of the present and look over the hills of the future. Another reason is the lack of sufficient information to evaluate the intrinsic value of an asset; and determine whether it’s undervalued or overvalued at current market price. That’s particularly the case when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Because there are hardly any “fundamental” metrics to appraise the “intrinsic” value of each coin, as is the case with conventional assets. Still there’s behavioral finance and technical analysis that provide a few tips to the daring souls ready to sift through the cryptocurrency maze for lucky coins—“fallen angels.” Still, investing on rather than fundamentals is an extremely risky game for very aggressive investors who are prepared to lose a great of money in a short period of time.

2018-01-31 21:22:00,Ripple,forbes,"Bitcoin, Ripple And Litecoin Sell-Off: What's Different This Time Around?","Shutterstock The current sell-off in Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies may have a long way to go before it’s over. For a “technical” reason: it’s broad, extending from major currencies to the smaller ones. When Bitcoin dropped close to 40% back in the middle of December, Ripple rallied, quadrupling in value in just a few days. The rally quickly spread to Ethereum, Litecoin, NEM, Siacoin and Bytecoin, and other cryptocurrencies. Then, as Ripple and other cryptocurrencies sold off a couple of weeks later, Bitcoin rallied. There’s a good explanation behind the rotation among cryptocurrencies. Some cryptocurrency exchanges require Bitcoins to pay for coin transactions. So investors who already owned Bitcoins had to sell them to pay for those transactions. 
 Rotation from one coin to another isn’t new to investing. It has been applied on Wall Street for years, where investors rotate funds between “defensive” and “cyclical stocks,” at times when interest rates, i.e. the “opportunity cost” of money, remain low. That’s bullish for stocks, because it confirms that money is staying within this asset class rather than moving back into money market investments. And that was a bullish sign for cryptocurrencies back then, too. [Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin).Continued from page 1 But that’s not what is happening this time around. With the exception of Ethereum, all major cryptocurrencies are down simultaneously. In the last seven days, Bitcoin is down 10.10%, Ripple is down 17.23%, and Litecoin is down 10.40%; and all are 50% or more below their all-time high back in December.

It is leaving the entire asset class. That’s bearish for all cryptocurrencies.

Sharp upturns have been followed by sharp downturns, with each upturn and downturn lasting only a few weeks or a few days. Thus far, the cryptocurrency roller coaster has helped speculators who have been on the right side of the market to amass fortunes. The trouble is that no speculator is smart enough or lucky enough to “time” the market. At least that’s what mainstream financial economics claims. Seven-Day Price Change For Major Cryptocurrencies 
 Source: Coinmarketcap.com 2/2/18 at 7:30 p.m. Sooner or later, speculators who play this game will find themselves on the wrong side of the market, losing the fortunes they amassed early on and then some. That’s why cryptocurrency investors should look beyond the current roller coaster, and ask where cryptocurrencies will be 20 years from now. [Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.] “Unfortunately, almost anything connected with the future of Bitcoin is speculative right now,” says Jason Labrum, founder and president of Labrum Wealth Management. “When you look at the sophistication level of the average person buying Bitcoin, it’s scary. They just see an asset that at times has gone up a whole lot in value, so you get a herd mentality of people wanting to jump on the bandwagon.” Labrum isn’t clear how things will look in 20 years from now. “It will be interesting in 20 years to look back on the conversations we are having today about Bitcoin. By then, cryptocurrency could be a normal part of everyone’s life, or it could be a once trendy thing that everyone has forgotten about.”Continued from page 1 Matthew Schutte, Director of Communications at Holo, takes a pessimistic view on cryptocurrencies. “By 2038, the euro, the dollar, and other national currencies will be largely extinct, but so will Bitcoin and the rest of the current generation of money-like cryptocurrencies.” But he’s optimistic on blockchain technology. “They will not have been killed off by some single new token of value - but will instead have been replaced by a vibrant ecosystem of cryptographic currencies — i.e. digitally signed signals — each designed to make particular flows of activity visible, so that the individuals, organizations, and communities that make use of them are better able to sense and steer,” adds Schutte. While it’s still unclear where cryptocurrencies and the technologies behind them will be twenty years from now, one thing is clear: volatility will continue in the cryptocurrency markets – and that is a game for speculators rather than investors.
