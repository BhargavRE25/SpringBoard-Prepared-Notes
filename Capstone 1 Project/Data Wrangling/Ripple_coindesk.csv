2017-10-09 14:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Rebound? XRP Price Jumps to 7-Week High - CoinDesk,"Ripple's native XRP token jumped to a near seven-week high of $0.28 yesterday despite technical indicators that suggested the cryptocurrency's recent rally might be overdone. While a re-test of the August 31 high of $0.26 was on the cards, the rally was something of a surprise given that the broader market is under pressure. At press time, the ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is up 10.47 percent at $0.27. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 33.33 percent, while month-on-month, it's up 27 percent. Even so, XRP is well short of its record high of $0.39 set in May. As such, the present XRP rally could be a result of renewed interest among traders ahead of anticipated publicity for the company. If so, that makes the cryptocurrency vulnerable to ""profit taking"" following the conclusion of the event. As of now, however, XRP bulls have no reason to fear. Price action analysis indicates the cryptocurrency is all set for a rally to possibly record highs. 
  The daily chart shows: A ""rounding bottom"" is a saucer-shaped formation suggesting bearish-to-bullish trend change. In XRP's case, that means the pullback after the May high of $0.39 is over and the bulls have regained control. The overbought RSI indicates an extended move to the upside. The term ""overbought"" indicates a market that has advanced to a point at which, historically, it has tended to reverse and move lower.

2017-10-06 15:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Is Ripple's Rally Over? XRP Price Runs Into Roadblock - CoinDesk,"Fresh off setting a one-month high, the price of ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is struggling to cut through resistance offered by a rising channel hurdle. At press time, the ripple-US dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is $0.24, and while that figure is up 4.24 percent on the day and 21.89 percent week-over-week, it seems further gains may be difficult. Potentially positive news drivers aside, price action analysis suggests XRP is struggling to hold above $0.21 (its September 27 high), meaning downside potential is still in play.

2017-10-04 15:15:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Ripple Price Consolidates, But Could It 'Swell' Higher? - CoinDesk","The cryptocurrency that powers Ripple's XRP ledger is showing signs it may be consolidating ahead of a boost. At press time, the XRP-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate seems to be building a base around $0.20-levels. The third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has gained 2.56 percent in the last 24 hours. Elsewhere, Ripple news was quiet, and no major news was observable on its major channels and company forums. But, while week-on-week XRP is trading dead flat, it's possible traders see opportunity in an upcoming event sponsored by Ripple. Notably, this month, Ripple is to host ""Swell"" - an event aimed at bringing the world's financial leaders together to network and discuss trends and strategies. Swell will go head-to-head with Sibos, Swift's annual banking and financial conference scheduled for October 16-19 in Toronto, Canada, and bring in speakers including World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee. 
 As search volumes have shown to be heavily correlated with cryptocurrency price activity, this could foreshadow brighter days ahead for the XRP/USD exchange rate. Still, it's possible that ripple is simply trading sideways alongside the general market.

2017-09-14 13:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Old Flames, New Code: Ripple and Hyperledger Reunite for Interledger Effort - CoinDesk","Ripple and Hyperledger might soon get a chance to reignite an old flame. Following an early promise by Ripple to contribute code to the Hyperledger blockchain consortium's open-source repository, the two organizations parted ways over differing opinions on blockchain design. Whereas Hyperledger's members largely focused on private blockchains that required permission to join, Ripple instead created hybrid technology featuring a cryptocurrency more reminiscent of a public blockchain. But now, the star-crossed companies have found an unusual Cupid who may have what it takes to finally bring them together: NTT Data, a Japanese system integration company. The story begins with NTT Data (through its subsidiary Everis) working on a new version of Ripple's open-source Interledger protocol beginning in July 2016. The plan was to reimplement Interledger using the Java computing language, since Interledger is currently only available in JavaScript. 
 When Ripple learned of NTT Data's efforts to rebuild the platform, the company was not only intrigued, it wanted to help. Together, the companies have submitted the results of that collaboration to Hyperledger, of which NTT Data is a founding member. If admitted, the new Interledger implementation could mean not just a new language for developers to build with, but a bridge to connect all of Hyperledger's open-source codebases, including Fabric, Sawtooth and Burrow. In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas expressed enthusiasm about the effort, yet also relayed that there are final obstacles to be overcome to finally make things official with Hyperledger. Thomas said: ""We are supporting that effort, but there's still a lot of decisions to be made."" Described in a November 2015 white paper as a bridge between traditional banking ledgers, public blockchains and private blockchains, Interledger has evolved into a product capable of conducting a single transaction across as many as seven different ledgers. And with that, NTT Data increasingly saw it as a way to connect its clients to a diverse set of the ""world's existing payment networks,"" according to Everis blockchain program manager Isaac Arruebarrena. In interview with CoinDesk, Arruebarrena explained how NTT Data, which last year conducted $15.7 billion (17 trillion Japanese yen) in sales, grew from being a founding member of Hyperledger in 2015, to identifying Interledger as ""one of the cornerstones"" of its corporate strategy. ""Our main goal is to become the best technology partner for the companies we work with,"" said Arruebarrena, adding that, while there is a complicated history between Interledger and Hyperledger, he's dedicated to bringing the two together. He said: ""We are determined to contribute to the evolution of the Interledger protocol in order to enable interoperability between distributed ledger platforms and financial institutions' existing ledgers."" However, several steps must be accomplished before NTT Data moves Ripple's proposal into Hyperledger, according to the project's executive director, Brian Behlendorf. First is the formal selection of a name, which is currently the unwieldy ""Hyperledger Interledger-Java,"" taken from the platform's key distinguishing trait. But Hyperledger members are currently discussing how to make the platform's name more accessible, and possibly more easily trademarked. Alternatives include Hyperledger Connect, Hyperledger Liquid, Hyperledger QuILt (IL standing for Interledger) and Hyperledger Jill (a portmanteau of Java and Interledger). Outside the collaborative naming process, the technical steering committee is now evaluating the code and could accept or reject it as soon as next week, but likely no later than ""another few weeks,"" said Behlendorf. Once the code is approved, he said, the collaboration will begin the onboarding process as an incubating project, adding, ""and then the fun begins."" Behlendorf concluded: ""As Interledger appears to be a compelling way to build bridges across chains to transfer messages and assets, it's something I personally really hope to see accepted into Hyperledger.""

2017-09-12 15:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,SBI Ripple Asia to Test Blockchain Bank Transfers Between Japan and South Korea - CoinDesk,"SBI Ripple Asia will reportedly begin testing a funds-transfer system using digital ledger technology (DLT) between Japanese and South Korean banks by the end of 2017. The company - a joint venture between Toyko-based financial services firm SBI and DLT payments startup Ripple - has already led a consortium of banks to complete a pilot implementation using Ripple's technology within Japan earlier this year. According to local media, SBI Ripple Asia will now work alongside blockchain and AI solutions provider DAYLI Intelligence for the expansion of the scheme into South Korea.  SBI Ripple Asia was founded in early 2016, with an eye to amplifying the use of Ripple products and services in Asian markets, as previously reported by CoinDesk. The venture is also planning a program, commencing in October, to train engineers from around 20 companies in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Companies involved include Nomura Research Institute, Toppan Printing and NEC, reports indicate.

2017-09-08 21:07:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Blockchain Firms Ripple, R3 File Dueling Lawsuits Over Crypto Contract Dispute - CoinDesk","Distributed ledger startups Ripple and R3 have become embroiled in a new legal battle, with both startups filing lawsuits related to a contract dispute between the two firms. Ripple alleged in a complaint filed today in the Supreme Court of California that R3 failed to honor an agreement that included an option to purchase 5 billion XRP, the cryptocurrency of Ripple's distributed ledger network. According to Reuters, R3 asked the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the deal, which would have allowed it to buy the XRP at a price of $0.0085 per token before September 2019. Currently, XRP is currently trading at roughly $0.21 apiece, according to data from CoinMarketCap. A copy of R3's complaint was not available at press time. According to Ripple's complaint, R3 and Ripple allegedly struck a deal to create a joint commercial venture, which would have followed an earlier test, centered around XRP, that involved a number of banks involved with R3's consortium effort. 
 In the complaint, Ripple accused R3 of failing to uphold its end of the bargain as its fundraising efforts picked up steam, ultimately concluding with a $107 million funding round announced this spring. Ripple also accused R3 of hiding the fact that several of its consortium members, including Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander, among others, were looking to exit the group despite promises of advancing XRP to the banks involved. A spokesperson for Ripple told CoinDesk in a statement: ""Our filing is straightforward - R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP's ~4000% increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement. We wish them well as they continue to try and build their consulting practice. In the meantime, Ripple is focused on serving our ecosystem of nearly 100 customers and signing up more."" When reached, a representative for R3 declined to offer specifics on the case but struck an optimistic note about the firm's prospects in court. ""R3 does not discuss the details of pending litigation,"" the spokesman said. ""We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter."" The suit is a notable one, given that R3 and Ripple are two of the industry's best-funded startups and both focus their products primarily toward financial institutions. R3 and Ripple have raised $107 million and $96 million, respectively, in venture capital to date.

Announced today, new members include Bexs Banco de Cambio, a processing service for international payments, and dLocal, the payment service behind Uber and GoDaddy. The other firms joining the network's now 100-plus members include Credit Agricole, Currencies Direct, IFX, TransferGo, Cuallix, Krungsri and Rakbank. In statements, Ripple was keen to position the group as not simply another blockchain consortium, saying its clients are successfully moving toward live implementations of products that can have a real business impact. For example, Ripple also revealed that financial services firm Cuallix will be the first partner to convert cross-border fund transfers into Ripple's native currency XRP. Specifically, the company plans use the token for fund transfers between the U.S. and Mexico in order to reduce processing costs, the release states. 
 ""Global payments are undeniably going through a sea change, led by financial institutions adopting blockchain to fix their customers' broken payments experience,"" said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, in statements. The new members join at a time when Ripple is actively pursuing high-profile partnerships with leading financial institutions worldwide while taking a more aggressive stance to differentiate its products and services.

2017-10-16 16:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Gates Foundation to Use Ripple Interledger Tech in Mobile Payments Push - CoinDesk,"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has released new open-source software for the unbanked that utilizes technology developed by distributed ledger startup Ripple. Announced today, Mojaloop is aimed at providing an interoperability layer between financial institutions, payment providers and other firms that offer such services to the poor and unbanked. Ripple's Interledger protocol, which is used to transact between different financial networks, is being used to help accomplish that goal. In addition to Ripple, three other financial technology firms participated in the development of the software. The app came out of the group's Level One Project, an umbrella initiative for its work with the unbanked poor that has seen it explore technologies like blockchain. The Gates Foundation has been weighing applications of the tech since as early as 2015, including its use as a way to bridge disconnected financial systems. 
 ""Interoperability of digital payments has been the toughest hurdle for the financial services industry to overcome. With Mojaloop, our technology partners have finally achieved a solution that can apply to any service, and we invite banks and the payments industry to explore and test this tool,"" Kosta Peric, the foundation's deputy director of financial Services for the poor, said in a statement. In addition to the direct work on Mojaloop, the project also saw four other mobile phone technology providers - Ericsson, Huawei, Mahindra Comviva and Telepin - develop a open API to speed up the pace of integrations.

2017-10-16 18:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Bernanke at Ripple Event: Blockchain Has 'Obvious' Benefits in Payments - CoinDesk,"Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is bullish on blockchain. Speaking at Ripple's Swell conference in Toronto today, being held the same week and in the same city as Sibos, the annual gathering hosted by Ripple's rival Swift, Bernanke told a room of several hundred attendees that he believes payments can be slow and expensive as designed using existing tools today. Bernanke, who led the U.S. central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, outlined the complicated process it would take for a bank in Germany to send a payment to a bank in the U.S., before saying: ""It's an obvious area where new technologies like blockchain or these electronic currencies can be used to improve the process."" 
 Bernanke, now a distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institute, called out Ripple by name, saying that he's read about the company's work and thinks that any effort in payments to reduce cost, improve accuracy, speed and reliability and ""bring the global economy closer together"" is a good thing. While the conversation mostly focused on monetary policy, Bernanke was asked to comment more on cryptocurrency and blockchain during the question-and-answer session, and his responses should come as no surprise as he gave bitcoin both muted praise and criticism as far back as 2015. Echoing those past statements, Bernanke said, ""bitcoin is meant to be an attempt to replace fiat currencies and evade government regulation and government intervention."" And that attempt, he contends, won't succeed because governments won't allow it. ""When bitcoin becomes a threat they'll take whatever action"" deemed necessary to quash it, he said. Unlike bitcoin, which works against regulators, he continued, blockchain businesses that collaborate with governments will likely see more momentum in terms of innovating on the payments system. Central banks around the world (including in Singapore, the U.K. and Europe) have taken more of an interest in blockchain technology recently, trying to figure out how it might create efficiencies within their systems. Case in point: earlier this month, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Jim Cunha said blockchain and other fintech startups would be pushing incumbent financial institutions and middlemen to be more innovative in their approach. When asked if bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and blockchain might affect monetary policy, Bernanke said he doesn't see that happening. Bernanke said: ""It could be a lack of imagination, but I don't think monetary policy has changed that much. [Central banks] are supportive of these new technologies because they'll improve the payment system ... but it won't affect the ability of the Fed to require a certain amount of reserves of affect interest rates.""

2017-10-17 11:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Downplaying 'Digital Assets': Blockchain Reigns at Ripple's Swell Event - CoinDesk,"At Ripple's inaugural conference, it was all about the use case. On day one of its much-anticipated Swell event in Toronto yesterday, panels largely centered on the distributed ledger company's existing clients and proofs-of-concept. There, representatives from Banco Santander and Siam Commercial Bank talked about how Ripple - and its XRP cryptocurrency - has provided a beneficial rail for cross-border payments. Yet, the event was largely pessimistic about the value proposition of other cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin and ether). Not only did former Federal Reserve chairman Dr. Ben Bernanke (who led the U.S. central bank during the 2008 financial crisis) question whether bitcoin would be successful, but many of Swell's panelists made it clear that just by speaking about blockchain technology, they were not promoting bitcoin and other ""unregulated"" cryptocurrencies. 
 Cryptocurrency's ""promise was to replace credit cards and banks and that's been an abysmal failure,"" said Patrick Griffin, senior vice president of business development at Ripple. He told the audience: ""Retail payments is nowhere. Every company that went out to do that, they've all pivoted. No one has doubled down on the merchant acquirer business."" Instead, Griffin continued, XRP is the only enterprise-grade option for banks and other mature financial institutions. To be fair, XRP wasn't pumped quite so hard until the last panel discussion, when Griffin got on stage with Marwan Forzley, CEO and co-founder of cross-border business-to-business payments provider Veem, and Oliver T. Bussmann, founder and managing partner at Bussmann Advisory. Most of the day, though, was spent discussing the advantages of distributed ledgers (also Ripple) over the current labyrinthine financial system. Not only does distributed ledger technology grant faster, cheaper and more reliable payments, but Ripple's position in the ecosystem will allow it to scale, according to Ed Metzger, head of innovation at Banco Santander. ""Payment networks derive value from ubiquity. And the positioning of Ripple in that space is very attractive,"" Metzger said. If you don't have a network, then the technology doesn't have value in the future, he continued. Since the summer of 2012 when Ripple first launched, the company has partnered with more than 100 financial institutions who are now utilizing its global payments network. As such, many of Ripple's clients were at the event, some on panels explaining the benefits they observed during proofs-of-concept with the company's technology. For Banco Santander, its Ripple trial has demonstrated that it can answer customer pain points, like the significant time it takes international remittances to reach their destination and the significant fees that are extracted from those transactions. ""There are use cases where speed and certainty of the amount being delivered are important,"" Banco Santander's Bussmann said. He continued, saying that the real question in the UK and throughout Europe is how can institutions replicate the real-time domestic payment system there for international payments. In separate panels, Dr. Arak Sutivong of Siam Commerical Bank and Veem's Forzley agreed. Sutivong said: ""The use case [for us] is cross-border remittance from Japan to Thailand. Overseas workers' hard-earned money in cash [is] sent back home with unknowns. They expect the money to get there on time and in full."" And Ripple has helped Siam Commerical Bank accomplish that. According to Sutivong, the bank has been transacting with real money for some time, although in a controlled PoC watched by the country's central bank. On Sunday, during the Swell conference's pre-events, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also announced it's using technology developed by Ripple with its release of open-source software Majaloop, which looks to provide an interoperability layer between financial institutions that offer services to the poor and unbanked. But with that being the only news to come out of Swell so far, XRP investors were seemingly less than ecstatic, selling off the cryptocurrency to drop the price about four cents during the day's events. Twitter was equally mixed in its reception of the event. While many congratulated Ripple on securing key partnerships with the financial incumbents, others were unimpressed. According to Twitter user Nayt Breeze: ""Wasn't impressed by the news seemed like a meeting of speculation."" The commentary highlights just how contentious Ripple has become over the years, having launched as a bank-focused cryptocurrency play at a time when most cryptocurrency enthusiasts were very much anti-establishment. But Ripple's executives have only fanned that fire. During the panel, Griffin also said that while cryptocurrency has a role to play in back-office cash management, the uses won't be consumer-facing. And he says that's because the technology lacks know-your-customer (KYC) features required by financial institutions and governments. While that could be seen as a fine complaint, one that puts Ripple ahead when it comes to mature financial services, Griffin's other accusations were a bit harder to parse. For instance, he said bitcoin could never succeed if it took four hours to move money from one account to another (which doesn't seem to be the case on average), and contended ether transactions can sometimes take 15 minutes. But yet, Griffin could not be swayed even as an audience member asked what the panelists thought was causing the rally around bitcoin. ""The best I can explain is, with a hope-and-pray approach for cryptocurrency investors, that they're betting that digital assets will have a use case eventually,"" he said, adding: ""Bitcoin, question mark. Ethereum ... with machines paying machines, that feels very far away. But for Ripple, there are already funds locked up in nostro-vostro accounts that can use XRP to create efficiencies now."" Yet, it's interesting that Ripple would bring up nostro-vostro accounts (local currency-denominated accounts banks hold throughout the world), as the talking point was also on display at a rival conference across town. There at Sibos, also in Toronto, Swift announced its blockchain PoC focused on freeing up funds in those accounts was a success. In context, many see Ripple's decision to throw an event on the same days in the same city as Swift's big annual Sibos conference as a way to rouse its competitor. During the panels and presentations at Sibos, presenters seemingly went out of their way not to mention Ripple, the blockchain startup that's taken aim at Swift in recent years. The closest anyone came was when the CEO of Swift Gottfried Leibbrandt took a jab at Ripple while describing the financial incumbent's Global Payments Initiative. But at Swell, some of the panelists seemed unfazed by the head-butting, speaking broadly about blockchain's advantages to the financial system. According to Bussmann: ""It's all about real-time execution ... which will be a must-do in the future. [Banks] are going to have to go through a fundamental structural change.""

2017-10-18 16:55:00,Ripple,coindesk,In 'Search' of a Swell? XRP Prices Rise and Fall Amid Ripple Event - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is on the decline at press time. And though it's a drop that's largely in line with bitcoin and the broader crypto asset class, there are conditions that perhaps make XRP worthy of exploration at present. For one, XRP has steadily gained altitude from its Sept. 15 low of $0.14, an uptrend that seems most likely to coincide with anticipation for big announcements at Swell, the conference the company launched on Oct. 16 to compete with rival Swift. A new (possibly annual) event designed to draw attention to its product suite, the conference spotlighted how Ripple is seeking to provide distributed ledger technology that could one day replace Swift, the organizer of the Sibos conference. 
 The result? Speculators who expected a boost from the visibility were likely not disappointed, though long-term holders might be. While during the conference, prices clocked a 7-week high of $0.30, the ripple-US dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is now trading at $0.22. At time of publication, the cryptocurrency has lost over 11 percent in the last 24 hours.  Stepping back, a look at the historical data adds evidence to the idea the Swell conference may have contributed to the boost. Google search results, for instance, show a strong correlation between search volumes and XRP price activity. Interestingly, search volumes for the term ""ripple price"" bottomed out in mid-September (around the time of its recent lows) and spiked ahead of the Swell event. The numbers point to close correlation between search volumes and ripple price activity. The chart shows:  Looking at the daily charts, the broader outlook remains constructive as suggested by the rounding bottom formation and repeated rebound from $0.15 levels.

2017-11-03 13:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Ripple Price Outlook Positive on Korean Volume, Analyst Prediction - CoinDesk","Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency has completed the round trip at press time. The ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate jumped to a high of $0.23 at 01:10 UTC today, only to fall back to the session's opening price of $0.21. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.20 and has gained 10.34 percent in the last 24 hours. But while the gains are in line with action seen in most of the market, social media suggests XRP may be gaining on bullish statements. Making the rounds is one report by Palm Beach Research Group, which suggests the analyst expects the cryptocurrency to outperform in 2018. A closer look at the charts, however, indicates the rally today may have a more certain cause: Korean desks offering XRP/KRW pairs. Trading volumes on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in South Korea, have gone up by 45 percent in the last 24 hours. 
 Volumes on exchanges offering XRP/BTC pairs have increased as well. That said, the volume pop was short lived as market attention shifted back to bitcoin. Still, the price action analysis in XRP favors the bulls.  The above chart shows: Binoculars image via Shutterstock

2017-11-16 13:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,American Express Opens First Blockchain Corridor With Ripple Tech - CoinDesk,"Back in 1927, pilot Charles Lindbergh could have flown cash across the Atlantic Ocean faster than most payments happen over that same body of water today. Whereas Lindbergh completed his historic solo flight from New York City to Paris in 33 hours and 30 minutes, a typical bank transaction today takes one to two days using Swift, and a typical ACH transaction can take twice as long. So, the news today that American Express has opened up a payments corridor using Ripple that can send money from England to the U.S. in just a few seconds has been a long time coming. A partnership with Spanish bank Santander, the new corridor is being positioned by Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, as an obviously faster, but also safer way to send payments across the Atlantic. 
 A former Swift board member, Treacher told CoinDesk: ""Whereas beforehand Amex had to send Swift messaging to the banks to request the payment to happen, now Amex is connected directly to the banks using Ripple and Ripple's cryptography, so that the movement of value happens immediately."" Run by American Express's foreign exchange international payments (FXIP) business, the corridor connects Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the UK using British pounds - all via Ripple's blockchain, RippleNet. According to Treacher, the integration routes non-card payments through the shared payment network for nearly instant, auditable cross-border payments. The project marks the latest development for Amex in a year that has seen the credit giant join the Hyperledger blockchain consortium and partner with the bitcoin app provider Abra. And for Ripple, which is coming off its recent Swell conference, the new work is another step toward letting its blockchain platform, tested throughout the first half of 2016, fly free. For example, Ripple recently connected Europe and the U.S. via its work with Swedish bank SEB, which late last year revealed its intentions to connect Stockholm with New York City using Ripple. Treacher said the SEB platform has already conducted $630 million-worth of transactions since it launched into production in Q2 of this year. While that project is advancing and is able to transact in nine seconds or less, according to Treacher, it is for now -- like the American Express project -- restricted to what he calls a ""pure"" blockchain that doesn't require a cryptocurrency. What both these projects have in common is ""a direct connection,"" he said. ""There's no intermediary cryptocurrency."" Going forward, however, Treacher expects that other banks will increasingly follow in the footsteps of financial services firm Cuallix, which last month became the first Ripple partner to convert cross-border fund transfers into the blockchain's native XRP token. Instead of holding dozens of what Treacher called ""exotic currencies"" in so-called nostro accounts around the world, Cuallix took the first step toward freeing up those funds otherwise trapped for new uses by holding the XRP itself. With Ripple's main competitor, Swift building its own blockchain using Hyperledger, and a rising tide of upstarts with their own variations on the cross-border payments use case, it's this use of Ripple's native cryptocurrency that Treacher thinks will elevate the company above the competition. ""Where these two come together is that as banks and users of banks, like American Express, adopt Ripple and start to connect up, XRP becomes an option they can use for liquidity purposes,"" he said, concluding: ""And that's where it really comes to life.""

2017-11-17 14:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Makes a Splash: XRP Price Looks Up on Amex News - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is trading on the front foot again. Having hit a 4-week high of $0.27 at 14:00 UTC yesterday, the Ripple-U.S. dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is back to at $0.23 at press time - up 7 percent on the day, as per CoinMarketCap. And though the spike has faded somewhat, there are reasons to be optimistic about the cryptocurrency's price going forward. The strong bid tone in XRP may be associated with yesterday's revelation that American Express (Amex) and Santander have teamed up with Ripple for direct cross-border payments via the company's blockchain tech. 
 Though XRP itself is not being used, Ripple's blockchain network will help facilitate the near-immediate transfer of funds from Amex's corporate customers in the U.S. to businesses that bank with Santander UK. Ripple has also said it expects XRP to play more of a role in future partnerships. Comments made by Ripple's CEO yesterday to Bloomberg can't be hurting the price, either. ""It's only a matter of time before central banks adopt blockchain to settle high-value, interbank fund transfers,"" Brad Garlinghouse told the news source. But while the news flow looks supportive of prices, the charts also favor further upside in XRP.  The above chart shows: A rounding bottom is a long-term reversal pattern that indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. A move above the neckline is usually considered a confirmation of the bullish trend. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

2017-11-21 22:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,BitLicense Architect Ben Lawsky Joins Ripple Board - CoinDesk,"Ben Lawsky, the former New York Superintendent of Financial Services who spearheaded the BitLicense regulatory framework while in office, has joined startup Ripple's board of directors. According to a press release from Tuesday, Lawsky will help Ripple advance its payment platform as well as its in-house digital asset, XRP. ""The company and its leadership are passionate about making our global financial system more efficient, more secure and more fair,"" he said in a statement. Lawsky is perhaps best known for establishing the BitLicense framework, the notable and at-times controversial regulatory scheme that took shape in 2013 and 2014 and came into effect the following year. Since then, only a few licenses have actually been awarded, and a still-active legal effort aiming to undo the BitLicense remains ongoing. 
 And though a new consulting firm created in 2015 raised the prospects of Lawsky advising the industry he once sought to regulate, the former NYDFS chief has largely stayed on the sidelines. In a departure, however, Lawsky last month spoke about possible regulations for initial coin offerings (ICOs) at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, saying the potential for fraud could cause ""a backlash against the entire bitcoin and crypto ecosystem.""

Unveiled today, the platform - which will connect corporates between Singapore and India - will be accessible through Standard Chartered's Straight2Bank system. According to SC's release, the platform will allow users to see all fees up front, pre-validate transactions and thereby more quickly settle them. Reports in March indicated that multiple banks, including Standard Chartered, have plans to launch a similar system across several countries next year. Further, the bank was one of a number of institutions of its kind to take part in a $55 million Series B round in Ripple in 2016. Gautam Jain, who serves as managing director and global head of client access for Standard Chartered, said in a statement: 
 ""The successful launch of our commercial cross-border payment service marks a significant milestone in the financial industry's progress in applying distributed ledger technology for corporates.""

2017-12-07 14:35:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Moving Up: IOTA Overtakes Ripple, Finds New Price Base - CoinDesk","Following an astonishing rally in recent days, the IOTA bulls look to be having a breather. IOTA exploded earlier this week, likely due to a newly announced partnership with Microsoft, Samsung and others for the launch of a data marketplace for the internet of things. The cryptocurrency, which was trading below $1 around 10 days ago, jumped more than 450 percent to hit a new lifetime high of $5.55 yesterday. That move erased previous record highs near $1.10 set on Aug. 17, and caused IOTA to jump up to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization on the CoinMarketCap rankings. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is at $3.50. Also as per CoinMarketCap, IOTA has depreciated by 26.17 percent in the last 24 hours. While the decline may look staggering, when compared to the 450 percent rally, the 33 percent drop feels nothing more than a good old technical correction. 
 Furthermore, the price chart analysis points to $2.50 as the new base for the cryptocurrency.  The above chart shows: IOTA prices may test $2.55 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in the next 24-48 hours (as the RSI and stochastic have turned lower from the overbought territory), but the support may hold, courtesy of the upward sloping 10-MA (seen sloping upwards towards the $2.50-$2.60 region tomorrow). Clearly, the base has shifted higher to $2.50 levels and it appears the rally is here to stay. Going forwards, a solid rebound from near $2.50 levels could translate into a rally to fresh record highs above $5.55 levels. Bubbles image via Shutterstock

2017-12-14 15:10:00,Ripple,coindesk,Up 50%: Ripple's XRP Sets Price Record Amid Overstretched Rally - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is scaling new heights today, but the rally looks overbought, according to price chart analysis. XRP was last seen trading at a record high of $0.70 on data source CoinMarketCap, and has gained over 50 percent in the last 24 hours. Further, its market capitalization has jumped to $23.63 billion, making it the fourth largest cryptocurrency globally. The token's six-month-long consolidation in the $0.15-$0.13 range ended with an upside break on Dec. 12 - seemingly due to increased demand for alternative cryptocurrencies as bitcoin passed over its recent record peak and started to appear overdone. Possibly boosting sentiment for the network was the news earlier this week that banks in Japan and South Korea are set to test cross-border payments using Ripple-based systems. However, XRP itself is not being used in the trial. 
 South Korean markets, though, have certainly played a role in boosting XRP's price. A look at the individual markets on CoinMarketCap shows that trading volume on Bithumb, one of the largest exchanges in the country, has jumped 35 percent in the last 24 hours. Clearly, the rally has substance, but it looks to be overstretched, as per technical analysis.  The above chart shows: The strong bullish momentum could push prices higher to $0.7255 (361.8 percent Fibonacci extension). However, as noted, the rally looks to be overstretched, and there is some probability of a pullback to $0.50 (ascending trend line on 1-hour chart). Hot-air balloon image via Shutterstock

Currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, XRP passed the milestone just before press time, achieving an all-time high of $1.06, as per CoinMarketCap data. The rally in XRP follows months of sideways trading for the cryptocurrency, which took an upwards turn a week ago following positive news flow for banking-focused Ripple, as well as generally surging prices among alternative coins as investors look to move money out of an overstretched and falling bitcoin. 
 Most recently, the company announced in late November that Standard Chartered and Axis Bank are launching a new cross-border payments platform built on top of Ripple technology. Just a week earlier, American Express said it was using Ripple's network to connect Santander clients in Europe and the U.S. Today's price gains, though, appear to be largely driven by the markets, particularly in Asia. Looking at CoinMarketCap data, XRP has seen trading volumes increase over the last 24 hours by nearly 25 percent at major South Korean exchange Bithumb, while Hong Kong-based Bitfinex has seen volumes rise over 10 percent. At press time, XRP is trading at $1.05. The cryptocurrency has gained 36 percent in the last 24 hours and is up 74 percent week-on-week. Its market cap currently stands at $41 billion, also a new record high.

2017-12-29 15:35:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Approaching $2 as XRP Price Doubles in Weekly Trading - CoinDesk,"A week after the value of Ripple's native XRP token topped $1 for the first time in history, the cryptocurrency surged again today, rising 34 percent. At press time, the token, used for transactions on the San Francisco startup's RippleNet cryptocurrency network, reached $1.87, a figure that was nearly double its listed price last week, data shows. The price rally arrived after a long period of inactivity in the market, which had held steady at $0.20 over the past six months. As a result, the market capitalization of XRP is now catching up with those of ethereum and bitcoin, according to data site CoinMarketCap. XRP is now the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with the value of its combined token supply now $72 billion. Data from CoinDesk indicates that much of today's price improvement comes from today's morning trading session (UTC 06:01 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.), where it recorded a 14.43 percent increase in the last six hours. 
 What's also notable is that global trading volume of XRP within 24 hours predominantly came from exchanges based in South Korea. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that three South Korean exchanges, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit account for 31.5, 7.3, and 2.07 percent of the worldwide XRP trading, respectively. In addition, within these exchanges, each has more than half of its trading activities concentrating on XRP, data also shows. The price rally also follows the South Korea government's newly issued policy that will ban cryptocurrency exchanges from allowing anonymous accounts, a move to curb market speculation in the country.

2018-01-03 17:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple's XRP Token Sets All-Time Price High Above $3 - CoinDesk," Just two weeks after it surpassed $1 for the first time, the price of XRP, the token that powers San Francisco startup Ripple's open-source RippleNet network, has set a new all-time high of $3. According to data site CoinMarketCap, XRP has climbed more than 21% in the last 24 hours, hitting a price of $3 just after 17:00 UTC today. Ripple's rally comes after hitting a temporary low of $2 immediately following its previous all-time-high of $2.85 on Dec. 30, 2017, according to CoinMarketCap. Still, XRP is up 144 percent on the week, and more than 1,000 percent month over month. The cryptocurrency was trading at $0.26 just over 30 days ago. With the change, XRP is also bringing a shake-up to the leaderboard of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. 
 At press time, XRP has heavily increased its lead over ethereum, long the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. While just 24 hours ago Ripple had a $17 billion lead, that figure has now increased to $26 billion. Ripple passed ethereum in market cap less than a week ago, and has been holding the number three spot on Dec. 29, 2017. As Ripple has climbed, so too has the overall cryptocurrency market, with the total market cap surpassing $713 billion just a day after it climbed past $667 billion. On the day's trading, 15 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap are in the green, with ethereum classic, Qtum, EOS, iota and bitcoin offshoot litecoin being the notable exceptions.

2018-01-04 18:25:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Fever? Other Crypto Assets Are Outpacing Its 2018 Gains - CoinDesk,"So-called alternative cryptocurrencies are making their presence felt in the first week of 2018, recording impressive gains that are drawing investors to options once considered risky. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rallied 1,900 percent last year. But, as prices neared the $20,000 mark in December, the relatively cheap ""small cap"" coins began to rise. With gains due, in part at least, to the rotation of money out of an overbought bitcoin, the broader cryptocurrency rally seems to have gathered pace in 2018. With 66 percent appreciation so far in 2018, Ripple's XRP token is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. That's impressive, yet XRP still ranks sixth on the list of top gainers so far this year, among those ranked in the top 25 by total value, as of 18:00 UTC. So which ""large-cap"" cryptocurrencies are leading the pack? 
  Overall, the TRON token tops the table with 270 percent gains since Jan. 1. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 100 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, and its market cap has tripled this week to $10 billion. In second place is the status network token (SNT) - an ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has gained more than 160 percent in value this year and is up 700 percent month-on-month. Stellar, which topped the list two days ago, has slipped to number three. It is now the seventh largest currency with a market cap of $9.97 billion. And although at a record high of over $1,000 today, ethereum's native token ether (up 28 percent this year) sits at the bottom of the table in 10th place. Interestingly, bitcoin ranks as low as 18 (up 2 percent this year), as prices have traded roughly sideways since the fall from its December all-time high.

2018-01-04 20:37:00,Ripple,coindesk,$100 Billion Controversy: XRP's Surge Raises Hard Questions for Ripple - CoinDesk,"Ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is on a bull run. According to CoinDesk data, the price of XRP is up over 1,000 percent in just the last month alone, eclipsing $3.50 per coin Thursday after spending much of 2017 under $0.30. With a market capitalization above $120 billion, the token has usurped ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency after bitcoin, and social media is rife with speculation about when it might take first place. But where some might see the kind of meteoric growth that's often associated with a breakout product, industry insiders have been quick to tap the brakes. Rather than herald the run-up as a success story, some are using the spotlight to revive long-standing controversies that have dogged the Ripple blockchain network, the startup that created it and its fair-weather approach to marketing the cryptocurrency. 
 Indeed, founded with the mission to bring bitcoin's decentralized, cryptographic architecture to financial services, Ripple has had a complex relationship with XRP - at times touting it as a way for banks to transact seamlessly across borders, while at other points describing it as a benign value-add to enterprise versions of the company's software. Such hot-and-cold thinking has long been on display in the company's public remarks on the subject. As far back as 2012, for instance, the founder and former CEO of Ripple, Chris Larsen, spoke of the service as a bitcoin-like payment system. Only a couple years later, Larsen was de-emphasizing XRP's role, telling the Financial Times, ""The world is not going to adopt a new math-based currency."" Seemingly aligning with a rise in regulatory concerns over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, executives at Ripple even explained to Fortune in 2014 that its cryptocurrency is not meant to be a store of value or a medium of exchange. And there were times when Ripple leadership hesitated to call XRP a cryptocurrency at all. Asked directly about its use of terminology in 2016, Larsen pegged the decision to marketing, dismissing the term outright. ""It's not powerful,"" he said then. ""I think sometimes the word 'crypto,' branding-wise, is less institutional than 'digital asset.'"" Yet, as the term ""cryptocurrency"" has come back into fashion over the past year, that narrative has changed. In contrast to his predecessor, Brad Garlinghouse, who replaced Larsen as CEO when he stepped down at the beginning of 2017, has proclaimed the value of cryptocurrency, specifically XRP. And in interview with CoinDesk Thursday, Asheesh Birla, who's been the vice president of product at Ripple for five years, said he doesn't remember anyone at the company downplaying the necessity of digital assets. Rather, he said: ""What we did realize is that there is a pragmatic way of developing use cases that will use digital assets. I think that is a very pragmatic approach of building a payments solution. I think the patience, and the pragmatic nature that we're working towards is paying off."" And Birla has a point - three years ago digital assets were thinly traded compared to today, so it was hard to market XRP as a liquidity play. Yet the company's shift in tone, coupled with the XRP cryptocurrency's recent boom, has brought out a sea of critics who want to take Ripple to task for its seemingly opportunistic stance. However, they're being met by an equally strong force: a new group of crypto adopters who, all of a sudden, see XRP as an affordable way to get exposure to cryptocurrency and relieve their FOMO. Given the passionate support of its online fanbase, it's perhaps not a surprise that Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency has attracted interest, especially as new investors seek to diversify in the cryptocurrency market. For instance, Ripple evangelist and XRP bull Tiffany Hayden wondered in a tweet whether XRP could jump 740 percent to reach $20 a coin, and while that might seem a stretch, it sounds more plausible when considering that XRP gained 30,000 percent over 2017. Further, according to a tweet from Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, if XRP's price stayed around where it's at today and bitcoin's stayed around $15,000 a coin, by the time each of those network's cryptocurrency units (100 billion for XRP, 21 million for bitcoin) had been released, the XRP Ledger would have a network value greater than bitcoin's. Since bitcoin hit $20,000 this past December, a slew of cryptocurrencies have reached new all-time highs, some even outperforming bitcoin by leaps and bounds. But what sets XRP's activity apart may be the sheer volume of crypto enthusiasts who, seemingly, are working under cloudy impressions of the industry. In speaking with retail buyers, CoinDesk has found that, for some, XRP is their very first foray into cryptocurrency. In one conversation, a source, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that a friend had pushed him to buy XRP. This investor also cited other reasons for taking the plunge: ""Surely, because of the advantage of transferring funds very quickly and efficiently anywhere in the world; also its endorsement by [potentially] Amazon and Amex. It didn't hurt that it went from 20 cents to $1 rather quickly."" It's an interesting answer that sheds light on the state of the crypto industry as it moves into 2018. Bogged down - at least in the eyes of new investors - by a years-long technical debate, bitcoin seems to have lost its hold on the faster, more efficient payment method use case. In turn, cryptocurrencies that seem more mainstream (such as XRP in its proximity to Ripple) are looking more attractive to rookies. Yet, the partnerships Ripple has forged recently hide an inconvenient truth - that enterprises using Ripple's services aren't necessarily using XRP. And as such, XRP investors might not understand they're buying into a cryptocurrency very different from bitcoin and the others that have gained widespread attention over the years. Case in point: While XRP investors might be charmed by the thought of holding a cryptocurrency that one day a large swath of the banking system may use, the vast majority of Ripple's banking clients are using the company's xCurrent product - a glorified messaging platform. This product provides banks with real-time, bi-directional messaging with which they can track and manage cross-border payments, and is superior, Ripple executives say, to SWIFT's messaging platform, which only allows for one-way communication. So for instance, if an account number, name or some other data needed to send a payment gets mistyped when sending a SWIFT message, that message must go through its life cycle before the error can be corrected, with the receiving party sending back an error-and-cancellation message. The sending bank then has to go find where it messed up, and once the errors are corrected, a new transaction must be initiated. (However, SWIFT recently revealed a real-time gross settlement platform and is experimenting with blockchain technology to enhance its processes.) Ripple's platform, on the other hand, allows senders and receivers to communicate in real time, so simple errors can be fixed quickly, and transactions aren't canceled, but instead merely put on a momentary hold of sorts. Laid out to CoinDesk during the company's inaugural Swell conference in Toronto in October, Ripple's main product doesn't involve its XRP token at all. Onstage during the event, a number of banks using xCurrent asserted that they would not be using XRP anytime soon, contrary to what XRP investors might be banking on today. And xCurrent is the platform American Express is using. In mid-November, Amex announced that it had partnered with Ripple to connect Amex customers in the U.S. using U.S. dollars to Santander bank accounts in the U.K. using British pounds. During the launch, Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, Marcus Treacher, told CoinDesk that Amex and Santander were connected directly with no need for an intermediary cryptocurrency. Yet, the price of XRP rallied on that news, hitting a high, for the time, around $0.30 per coin. And now, with the price of XRP continuing its upward momentum, there seems to be another pump based on misperceptions about the Amex relationship and speculation that Amazon will accept XRP sometime this year  - both were mentioned by the anonymous neophyte as reasons he's investing in XRP. Secondly, many investors new to the cryptocurrency space might not be aware of where all the XRP actually exist. Unlike bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, XRP isn't created on a particular timeline through mining  - or the act of securing decentralized networks. Instead, the 100 billion XRPs (the cryptocurrency's coded limit) are already available, with most under the control of Ripple itself. Ripple currently controls about 61 billion XRP, although in May (where the price ranged from 5 cents to 41 cents) the company announced it would move to lock up 55 billion XRP is escrow, to be released at a rate of 1 billion a month for at least four and a half years. According to Birla, that lock-up started in December, and any XRP not used during the month is put back into the escrow accounts. In May, Garlinghouse told CoinDesk funds were being spent at a rate of 300 million per month, but Birla declined to disclose any updates to that number. Yet, Birla did say, with the price increase, the company would be re-evaluating what it needs. First and foremost, XRP's rise on old news and unconfirmed speculation displays one of the challenges within the crypto market - that there's no foolproof way to value cryptocurrencies. And not only that, but the definition of cryptocurrency is a bit murky as well. Because XRP's use is fixed to the Ripple Network, its protocol doesn't involve any mining and Ripple itself controls the majority of tokens, many long-time crypto enthusiasts would put XRP in a separate (albeit in some ways similar) bucket from bitcoin and other, more decentralized cryptocurrency projects. ""XRP will go down as the Icarus of cryptocurrency,"" tweeted Preston Byrne, an outspoken blockchain pundit, referencing a Greek mythological tale about hubris. In an interview, Byrne said he finds extremely troubling the trend of private companies issuing their own monies, retaining some for employee compensation and working capital, listing them on exchanges for speculation and then selling their monies on those exchanges to fund operations. Byrne, the founder of Tomram Consultancy and former general counsel of blockchain startup Monax, told CoinDesk: ""The scale of this activity has become distinctly market-distorting. My greatest fear is that these schemes could, if left unchecked, lead to a systemic crisis."" And chief among the criticisms leveled at Ripple is that the project is not truly decentralized, and so is little more than blockchain hype on a traditional system. The bitcoin developer and perennial blockchain skeptic Peter Todd has recently taken to tweeting a number of his concerns, and while they're all focused around the question of decentralization, his real uneasiness with Ripple revolves around the company's opaqueness. Ripple relies on a Unique Node List (UNL) - currently encompassing five core validators all run by Ripple - when matters of consensus need to be determined. According to Ripple, it cannot recommend any new validators to this list. In Todd's interpretation, Ripple has been slow to add new nodes to the UNL primarily because these validators must be trusted entities that stay in consensus with Ripple itself. And while a number of people and organizations run nodes on the Ripple network, according to Todd, choosing to route transactions through a node that's not a part of the UNL means that if your node comes to a different determination about the state of consensus than those nodes run by Ripple, it could split you off onto a separate ""Ripple"" chain. While Birla seemed to acknowledge the issue in conversation, he also said XRP Ledger (which was rebranded from Ripple Ledger last year) was decentralized in that it is open for anyone to use or build on top of. ""Anyone can download the XRP ledger package and become a validator and start broadcasting immediately, but getting everyone else to listen to you is a second point,"" Birla said. To address the paltry number of trusted nodes on the UNL (in comparison, bitcoin has about 10,000 validating nodes and ethereum has about 30,000), Ripple released a scaling roadmap which stated it intends to increase the number of trusted nodes on the UNL to 16 over the next 18 months. But according to Todd: ""The really dangerous thing here is Ripple's technical documentation doesn't make any of these risks clear - nowhere do they describe in detail how nodes can fall out of consensus with one another if their UNLs don't match."" Todd continued, saying that for Ripple's bank clients, being transparent about it's model as a centralized system that users can fully validate shouldn't be much of a problem.. ""For some customers that may even be seen as an advantage,"" Todd told CoinDesk. Yet, he alleges that Ripple muddies the waters because ""they don't want the market to lose confidence in XRP."" This much is clear: right now the market has a lot of confidence in it. Yet, while it seems people are rushing into XRP ahead of any real use of the cryptocurrency, Birla said that more companies will be announcing their use of XRP in the first quarter of 2018. Birla said he expects a ""full list"" of XRP users this year, telling CoinDesk about the xRapid product, which is basically xCurrent with XRP on top: ""There is a whole pipeline of folks now integrating into that product. We'll release names early this year."" He continued, saying the success of getting banks to use Ripple's non-cryptocurrency-related products is positioned as the first step of a bigger plan to move banks to XRP. And Ripple has had success in getting financial institutions to see the value in its xCurrent product. In total, since it started its ""war"" on SWIFT and the legacy financial system, more than 100 companies have joined its network. As far as XRP itself is concerned, though, only one company has publicly revealed its use of the cryptocurrency. In October, Mexican financial services firm Cuallix partnered with Ripple to convert cross-border fund transfers into XRP for easy delivery between currencies. When asked whether new XRP investors understand the relationships between Ripple, its clients and XRP, Birla said, ""Big names like Amex and smaller names, like other companies were signing, are all helping build out the network. We're adding on the liquidity [part] after that"" - that is, the xRapid product that uses XRP. He continued, ""We've been really clear. The way that we looked at solving problems was a very methodical approach, a pragmatic approach.""  According to him, XRP's use case couldn't be realized until Ripple had built out the network. ""We've identified a use case, we've identified a pain point, we have real customers using our product,"" Birla said, concluding: ""We have continued to get market traction. That has continued to get a lot of interest in Ripple and XRP in general.""

2018-01-05 14:16:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Eyes Retreat After Record Price Highs - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP token may have found a short-term top and there's potential for a sustained pullback in prices, price charts suggest. As per data source OnChainFX, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market value is down 15 percent from a record high of $3.84 set yesterday. Over 24 hours, XRP is down 10 percent. A look at the top 10 ripple markets shows that the sharp retreat from the yesterday's high is mainly due to losses in the XRP/KRW (Ripple-Korean won) pair. Also, profit taking in XRP/BTC (Ripple-bitcoin) may have played a role in dragging down XRP. While the price action looks toppy, the technical charts indicate there is scope for a deeper pullback. As of writing, XRP is trading below $3.00 on western exchanges, while, in Asia, the price is still well above $3.50 levels. 
  The above chart (prices as per Bitstamp) shows:  The above chart shows bearish price RSI divergence (lower highs on the RSI) and falling tops as represented by the descending trendline on the price chart. Meanwhile, the rising trendline could offer support at $2.35 levels.  The topping pattern seen on the XRP/BTC chart adds credence to the bearish case put forward by XRP/USD (discussed above) and the rise in bitcoin seen today. The close today below BTC 0.00016276 (yesterday's doji candle low) would confirm a bearish doji reversal and could yield a pullback to sub-0.00010 BTC levels.

2018-01-05 15:55:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Claims 3 Big Money Transfer Firms Will Use XRP in 2018 - CoinDesk,"Three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide will be implementing Ripple's XRP token in their payment flow systems this year, the company said in a tweet Thursday. The tweet, which did not identify the partners, comes as XRP has rallied to overtake ethereum as the No. 2 cryptocurrency by market cap while Ripple has been criticized for its fairweather and sometimes opaque way of talking about the token. Part of the criticism stems from Ripple having scored more than 100 financial institutions to use its xCurrent product, a messaging platform that does not involve XRP, and many new investors mistaking that for XRP support by those institutions. Before Thursday, only one enterprise - Mexican financial services firm Cuallix - had announced its use of XRP for cross-border money transfers. 
 But the company tweet, and comments to CoinDesk from Asheesh Birla, vice president of product at Ripple, earlier this week, suggest that more will be added this year. In another tweet late Thursday, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse responded to a New York Times article casting doubt over XRP's usage by sharing comments he said were from banks and payment providers who examined or tested the cryptocurrency. Referencing Ripple's xRapid product, which puts XRP on top of the company's xCurrent messaging platform, Garlinghouse wrote: ""Over the last few months, I've spoken with actual banks and payment providers. They are indeed planning to use xRapid (our XRP liquidity product) in a serious way."" Despite its recent run to nearly $4 per coin, XRP is down on the day, following a statement by Coinbase that it does not have plans, at this time, to list the cryptocurrency (or any other new ones) on either its flagship exchange or its GDAX platform.

2018-01-10 15:25:00,Ripple,coindesk,Down Not Out? Ripple Bulls May Regain Momentum - CoinDesk,"The 50 percent decline of Ripple's XRP token from the record highs may have strengthened the bears, but chart analysis indicates further downside may be limited. As per data source OnChainFX, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 16.85 percent in the last 24 hours. As of writing, XRP is trading at $1.88 levels. Part of the price drop from $3.36 to $2.07 witnessed on Monday can attributed to data provider CoinMarketCap's  unannounced decision to exclude three Korean exchanges, causing its global average to suddenly drop. The resulting selloff came to halt after the change in average calculation methodology became public, allowing for a partial recovery in the XRP price to $2.46. However, the relief was short-lived. XRP fell below $2.00 yesterday and hit a 12-day low of $1.71 today. 
 The decline in prices over the last 48 hours highlights the bearish undertone across the wider crypto markets. Stellar lumens has dropped by 15 percent over a 24 hour period; NEM and cardano are down 13 percent and 15 percent, respectively; while TRON has lost a hefty 24 percent in value. Fighting the trend, the top performer is ether (ETH), which hit a new all-time high of $1,417 today. ETH has gained around 11 percent over 24 hours.

2018-01-11 15:05:00,Ripple,coindesk,MoneyGram to Pilot Ripple's XRP Token - CoinDesk,"International money-remittance firm MoneyGram is partnering with Ripple to test the startup's XRP token for international payments. According to a  press release, MoneyGram will test Ripple's xRapid service due to its claimed speed and cost efficiency. The release noted that XRP transaction fees are significantly less than those of the bitcoin network. While existing money transfer companies need to have pre-funded accounts in different nations to ensure they are able to facilitate transactions, using XRP means the company can directly transfer funds from one country to another instead, Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse said. Garlinghouse continued: 
 ""The inefficiencies of global payments don't just affect banks, they also affect institutions like MoneyGram. ... By using a digital asset like XRP that settles in three seconds or less, they can now move money as quickly as information."" The companies will also test Ripple's other products, including xVia, according to the release. MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said the company looks forward to using xRapid in its pilot program, adding: ""We're hopeful it will increase efficiency and improve services to MoneyGram's customers.""

2018-01-24 17:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Two More Companies Sign On to Test Ripple's XRP in xRapid Pilots - CoinDesk,"Telecom provider IDT and international payments service group Mercury have announced that they will pilot Ripple's xRapid for money transfers. The two companies become the latest to sign onto the product, which uses the firm's XRP token, following news that remittance major MoneyGram was testing it for internal processes. Ripple had previously announced last October that Cuallix, a Mexican financial services firm, was using XRP. As indicated in statements, the aim is to improve the speed of payments to a point at which they are occurring in real time. In tandem with that goal, the companies are looking to the tech as a way to drop the overall cost of transacting. Alfredo O'Hagan, SVP of IDT's consumer payments business, said in a statement: 
 ""We're excited to pilot Ripple's xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost."" ""Payment providers like IDT Corporation and MercuryFX are early movers because they understand what XRP can do for their business and customer experience,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said of the announcement. ""We're excited to have them at the forefront of the Internet of Value.""

2018-01-25 12:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Former Ripple Exec Invests $57.5 Million in Uphold - CoinDesk,"Digital money platform Uphold today announced it has received a $57.5 million investment from former Fed Reserve senior analyst and Ripple chief risk officer Greg Kidd. Kidd, who will join Uphold's board of directors, will also help fund the creation of a research and development arm, to be called Uphold Labs, through his investment vehicle Hard Yaka. Kidd has previously invested in Coinbase, Square and Twitter. In a statement, the investor praised Uphold's scalability, as well as its compliance practices. In addition to forming Uphold Labs, the investment will help fill Uphold's loss assurance to roughly 20 percent of its crypto holdings, protecting its users from potential losses due to cryptocurrency volatility or other issues. 
 Kidd told CoinDesk: ""Because of the strength of Uphold's compliance and controls, I'm willing to pledge a certain amount of my balance sheet, or the balance sheet of my venture company ... as a reserve. That means that if there was some adverse effect at Uphold that might put it otherwise in a position of operating as a fractional reserve, this is like an insurance program that will make sure that user balances are protected."" A spokesperson for Uphold said the licensing revenue and development wing will receive 20 percent of the funding, which will be used to add more cryptocurrencies to increase the firm's connectivity to financial systems, as well as for use in Ripple-related projects. Then, 45 percent will go to equity, and the remaining 35 percent will be shifted to its reserve balance sheet. The partnership will help Uphold provide ""unprecedented asset protection,"" said chief executive Adrian Steckel. Formerly called Bitreserve, before its rebrand in 2015, Uphold offers foreign exchange and international remittances in bitcoin and fiat currencies. It also provides e-commerce services.

2018-01-29 13:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,In Their Own Words: Real Companies Talk Ripple XRP Pilots - CoinDesk,"Just one - before this month, that's how many financial firms had publicly expressed interest in using Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP. Indeed, the blockchain startup has no lack of partners, from American Express to SEB, that use its xCurrent product, which allows financial institutions to send transactions in real-time without the innovative new crypto-asset. But it was only a little-known company (Mexico-based Cuallix) that had signed on to use Ripple's xRapid to leverage XRP for liquidity. Flash forward to today, however, and the narrative has seen a shift. In rapid-fire succession, three money transfer firms revealed they are piloting the use of XRP. First was remittance giant MoneyGram, then came Mercury FX (which conducts about $500 million in transaction volume per year) and finally telecom provider IDT. 
 To many, the news has been a vindication - not just for Ripple, but for the millions of mainstream investors that have embraced XRP as an alternative investment, helping it rise from mere cents early last year to nearly $4 this month. And while it's still an open question as to whether such tests will go live, during the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse framed the general skepticism as old-fashioned and out of touch. Garlinghouse told attendees: ""When I hear banks say, 'We're not going to use digital assets,' I hear Randal Stevens say 'AT&T will never use IP.'"" So far, the largest interested party in XRP is legacy money transmitter MoneyGram, which in addition to being valued at $700 million, has over 350,000 locations around the world at which customers can pick up cash. However, the pilot does not directly serve any of those locations, according to a spokeswoman. Instead, the pilot is focused on implementing XRP within Moneygram's internal corporate treasury transactions. In an email, she described an internal pilot for back-office functionality only. ""MoneyGram is not using XRP in customer transactions,"" the spokeswoman told CoinDesk. That might seem a bit strange, since a whopping 89 percent of Moneygram's revenue in 2016 was generated from its money transfer service, according to the company's most recent annual report, and XRP (and other cryptocurrencies) are widely targeted at cross-border money movement. But while those potential XRP use cases aren't being tested yet within MoneyGram, Holmes said what the company learns from the internal pilot could someday inform much broader applications. The spokeswoman said: ""The goal is to investigate whether it is efficient in terms of time and cost and to see if it can be a viable addition to our FX trading."" Perhaps more notably, London-based Mercury FX's interest in XRP is geared towards consumer-facing applications. ""I imagine we will be able to begin using XRP for customer payments in the coming months,"" the founder and director of Mercury FX, Alastair Constance, told CoinDesk. He continued, saying, ""As with all things, we will start with more modest sums in the thousands of dollars and increase by orders of magnitude from there. Come to the end of the pilot we will not be surprised if XRP is carrying single transactions across the blockchain of a million dollars or more."" By far the most detailed pilot, the Mercury FX project will use xRapid to conduct payments for goods and services in China and Mexico, with the hope that it will expand to other emerging markets via partnerships with Ripple and other platforms. While the software for the pilot is currently being integrated with Mercury FX, Constance said the pilot won't likely formally begin for two more months, before concluding about three months after that. Not all of Mercury FX's nearly $500 million in annual transaction volume will be conducted with XRP anytime soon, though, as Constance said he's also exploring using some of Ripple's other blockchain products that don't require XRP. ""Crypto is building into crypto from one side and fiat needs to build from the other side,"" he said. ""Ripple lets fiat companies like us do that."" While XRP dropped from its nearly $4 highs, it's held relatively stable between $1 and $1.50. Yet, it'll be interesting to see how news of new pilots and interest affect the price of the cryptocurrency, especially if new details about Cuallix's work and IDT's pilot are revealed. IDT declined to comment for this report, other than to point to its existing statements, where Alfredo O'Hagan, SVP of IDT's consumer payments business said, ""We're excited to pilot Ripple's xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost."" Cuallix did not respond to inquiries before press time. Of note also though, is another, newer use case for XRP - as venture capital. Last week, online marketplace Omni revealed it had accepted a venture investment largely in XRP, which it plans to use in part to pay the bills -- such as paying freelancers. With all these new projects implementing XRP into the plan, no one is possibly more relieved than Ripple executives themselves, who had known of the interest, but had largely been unable to share it with the public. Ripple's head of product, Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk: ""We're pleased to be able to share how payment providers are implementing xRapid to improve their payments flows. Remember, we just built and launched xRapid late last summer. This is just the beginning."" Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

2018-01-29 17:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Vets Raising Money for Crypto Hedge Fund - CoinDesk,"Two former employees of distributed ledger startup Ripple are raising money for a cryptocurrency hedge fund, public records show. Twin filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated Jan. 25 and 26 show that co-founders Tim Lewkow and Eli Lang are seeking funds to back Fractal Investments, which invests in crypto-assets, per its official website. The company dates back to last summer and has maintained a public profile primarily through its Twitter account. Lang is formerly creative director for Ripple, having begun working for the San Francisco-based startup in 2012. Lewkow worked for Ripple from December 2013 until June of last year, most recently serving as integration engineering manager, according to his LinkedIn account. The filings detail two vehicles, Fractal: Virtual Currency Investment Fund I LP and Fractal: Private Investment Fund LP, both of which are incorporated in Delaware. Neither filings indicate how much money is being raised for either entity. 
 The developments perhaps highlight the continued drive to establish hedge funds and other financial entities amidst a period of heightened activity in cryptocurrency markets and development around the tech more broadly. Like others, Fractal is looking to invest in the growing ecosystem of digitized assets. And even as traditional investors move to invest in the space, others are pushing even further. As reported last week, a group of former Wall Street vets has raised as much as $50 million to create a fund of funds focused on cryptocurrencies.

2018-02-01 14:46:00,Ripple,coindesk,Back at $1: Ripple's XRP Retreats Amid Market Sell-off - CoinDesk,"Ripple's XRP token is taking a beating amid a broad losses across the cryptocurrency markets. The price of XRP fell to a two-week low of $0.99 today, according to CoinDesk's Ripple Price Index. The XRP/USD exchange has depreciated by 11.86 percent in the last two hours, indicates CoinMarketCap. As of writing, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $1.01. XRP was last seen this low on Jan. 17 when prices fell to $0.85. The recovery that ensued then ran out of steam in the $1.72 neighborhood on Jan. 18. Since then, XRP has been steadily losing altitude, creating lower highs (bearish prices) on the price chart despite big financial firms publicly expressing their interest in the blockchain startup's technology. 
 That said, XRP is not the only loser today. Except for ethereum's ether token, all top 20 currencies by market capitalization are trading in the red. Bitcoin has dropped by 8.69 percent in the last 24 hours. Cardano and Stellar are down 14 percent, while bitcoin cash has depreciated by 10 percent. The price chart suggests that XRP could extend the decline to 0.8647 levels.

2018-02-02 20:15:00,Ripple,coindesk,Santander to Roll Out Ripple-Powered App in 4 Countries - CoinDesk,"Ripple has landed one of its largest clients yet, with Santander Group announcing a mobile app powered by the company's distributed ledger. The bank had been piloting the app for 18 months with its employees, integrating Apple Pay for payments between £10 and £10,000 ($14 and $14,000), according to Finextra. The app will be rolled out in Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Poland, according to the company's 2017 earnings presentation. Customers will be able to use the app to facilitate same-day cross-border payments in under a minute, according to the slide. The app will also provide a digital wallet, a personal finance manager and help aid person-to-person payments. A Santander spokesperson said the company plans to launch the app in the next few months, and that it will use Ripple's xCurrent in the project. 
 Ripple's xCurrent product does not use XRP, the company's native cryptocurrency. Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse announced the move to his followers on Twitter, noting that the app will be released this quarter. Separately, Ripple spent about $84 million of XRP from its nearly $1 billion January reserve last month, according to current market prices. The company had access to 1 billion XRP last month, meaning the remaining 900 million went back into escrow at the end of January. The funds were transferred back through two transactions, with the 900 million XRP holding a value of $756 million at press time. The company has 61 billion XRP valued at $51 billion locked up in escrow over the next four years through a series of smart contracts. Ripple's escrow movement was developed as a way to increase trust in XRP. Due to Ripple's own holdings, limiting access to the tokens from even the developers prevented massive token dumps which could tank the price. Each month, 1 billion XRP is released to the company for internal use. While in the past, Ripple used on average some 300 million XRP per month, it appears to be requiring fewer of its reserve tokens, at least according to this one data point.

2018-02-03 12:40:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple's XRP Worst Hit By January Market Decline - CoinDesk,"Large-cap cryptocurrencies may have had a stellar 2017, but 2018 hasn't been so kind. Among crypto assets with over $1 billion in invested value, Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency may have been the biggest disappointment to newer investors, declining sharply amid heightened scrutiny after a period in which it became an industry darling for new investors. Still, XRP was far from alone in its sizable declines. Bitcoin forks saw a similar sell-off, with bitcoin cash (BCH), which forked from the network in August, and bitcoin gold, which quickly followed, falling sharply amid a broad market decline. 
  Entering January, it's safe to say investors were high on XRP. A key product for one of the most well-known industry startups, the digital asset won no shortage of favor from investors enamored by its goal of disrupting an oligopolistic global payments industry. And the company provided fresh reasons for the interest. By the time XRP had become the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide were said to be in the process of implementing XRP in their payment flow systems. However, as the month progressed, the optimism failed to keep XRP bid. A rumored listing on Coinbase never happened, and this, coupled with a broader market weakness weighed heavily over XRP. As of now, XRP is changing hands at $0.89 - a figure that's down almost 80 percent from its record high.  Bitcoin cash (BCH), a fork of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, soared in the fourth quarter of 2017, as investors took note of the faster transaction speed and low fees. Not only that, its surprise listing on Coinbase's GDAX exchange in December boosted its appeal, while cryptocurrency exchange CoinEx implemented bitcoin cash as its default currency in January. Still, it wasn't all green for BCH, as it dropped 41.29 percent last month, possibly due to fears of stricter regulations in South Korea and China, the latter region being one from which it draws the majority of its support. As of writing, BCH is trading at $1,169, down around 72 percent from its all-time high.  Created via a fork of bitcoin in mid-November, bitcoin gold (BTG) surged to record highs in 2017. Still, despite the temporary highs, in its initial days, it was perhaps the most unloved of bitcoin's many forks. Back then, the investor community felt BTG was overvalued with few (or no) apparent use cases. Entering January, it seems that sentiment won out, as BTG was one of the worst performers in January amid broad market sell-off. As of writing, BTG is trading at $108, down 78 percent from lifetime high.

2018-02-07 14:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Blockchain Network Adds China Payments Provider - CoinDesk,"Chinese payment provider LianLian International is joining RippleNet, the payment network that uses Ripple's blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border transactions. Announced on Feb. 7, the news will see the Hong Kong-based LianLian International adopting Ripple's xCurrent solution in an effort to bring same-day, cross-border transactions onto a blockchain for its existing customers. The product differs from Ripple's xRapid solution, which, unlike xCurrent, uses the company's custom cryptocurrency XRP. Arthur Zhu, CEO of LianLian International, said in a statement: ""With RippleNet, we will further enhance that experience by offering customers instant, blockchain-powered payments across the 19 currencies that we currently support."" 
 According to Ripple, the partnership with LianLian will enable existing RippleNet members to connect with the Chinese market. With the news, LianLian becomes the latest member of RippleNet, which according to a previous CoinDesk report, now has over 100 customers using its xCurrent solution.

2018-02-12 17:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,UAE Remittance Firm Partners With DLT Startup Ripple - CoinDesk,"A remittance firm based in Abu Dhabi has inked a new partnership with distributed ledger startup Ripple. UAE Exchange will use the company's RippleNet product for cross-border transactions, with the aim of reducing the cost and frictions associated with such transactions. It was reported last year that the company, which says it operates nearly 800 branch locations in 31 countries, was eyeing a deal to use Ripple's technology. In statements, UAE Exchange said it was looking to deploy the tech in a bid to boost its competitive edge in the market for remittances. ""The early adoption of this game-changing technology allows us to offer a competitive service, as it will have an impact on the speed and cost of cross-border transactions,"" Promoth Manghat, the company's chief executive, was quoted as saying by Business Insider. 
 The company will not use Ripple's XRP token as part of its deal. Instead, the exchange will use Ripple's broader technology stack for executing transactions. The UAE Exchange marks the latest firm to sign on with Ripple, which has announced partnerships with firms like LianLian, Santander UK, IDT Corporation, Mercury FX and MoneyGram in recent days. LianLian is also using RippleNet, while Santander UK is utilizing xCurrent, another Ripple product. Mercury FX, IDT Corporation and MoneyGram are all trialing Ripple's xRapid product, which makes use of the company's XRP token.

2018-02-14 16:20:00,Ripple,coindesk,Saudi Central Bank to Test Ripple Payments Tech - CoinDesk,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple has struck a deal with Saudi Arabia's central bank on a pilot program that will see banks in the country trial the company's tech. Announced today, the pilot with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority marks the second central bank to work with the startup, coming after the Bank of England, the U.K.'s central bank, began working with Ripple last year. Word of the latest deal first emerged earlier this week following comments from CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the Blockchain Connect Conference in San Francisco. ""This ground-breaking pilot program is the first of its kind to be launched by a central bank. Participating banks from the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] will use xCurrent to instantly settle payments sent into and out of the country, with greater transparency and lower costs,"" Ripple said. That the banks in Saudi Arabia would look to pilot xCurrent is perhaps unsurprising given recent interest in the Ripple product by other notable financial institutions. Earlier this month, CoinDesk reported that Santander is in the process of rolling out a mobile payments app that uses the xCurrent tech (which does not rely on Ripple's XRP token), with Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Poland serving as the initial markets for that release. 
 The announcement also comes a day after news emerged that UAE Exchange, a major remittance company in the United Arab Emirates, had signed on to use the startup's RippleNet product to manage cross-border payments. Separate from the Saudi Arabia news are reports about tests being conducted by remittance giant Western Union, which confirmed in an earnings call yesterday that it is piloting the startup's tech. Fortune reported today that, per a spokesperson, the company is testing payments using XRP. ""We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,"" Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. ""And we do test, we do have some tests with Ripple."" Ripple said as far back as 2015 that it was working with Western Union, though the remittance company didn't comment at the time.

2017-07-20 16:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Reports Uptick in Investor XRP Interest as Sales Triple in Q2 - CoinDesk,"A new report from distributed ledger startup Ripple suggests institutional investors are increasingly interested in its native cryptocurrency, XRP. According to the San Francisco startup, its licensed subsidiary sold $31 million worth of XRP during Q2 2017. The figure was up threefold from Q1, when it recorded $6.7 million in sales. According to the report, $21 million in such purchases came from institutional investors who actively approached the company through Ripple's licensed money service business. The company sold an additional $10.3 million XRP in a more passive way through sales of the asset to fund its operations. On public exchanges, Ripple also noted an increasing volume of fiat-for-XRP purchases during the same period, again suggesting an increasingly more mainstream audience. 
 While bitcoin contributed to 85% of total exchange-traded XRP volume in Q1, this number dropped to 63% by the end of June, according to the company. As of press time, XRP is trading at $0.17, down from $0.40 on May 17, its most recent all-time high.

2017-08-15 16:45:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Ripple Confirms China Expansion Plans, Shoots Down Alibaba Rumor - CoinDesk","Ripple is opening up about its plans to enter one of the world's largest markets. In new statements to CoinDesk, the San Francisco blockchain startup aimed to address rumors that first appeared last Thursday on XRP Chat, a forum dedicated to gossip and commentary on both the company and its technology. In short - yes, the blockchain company is planning to set up operations in China, but no, it's not doing so with the help of one of the region's e-commerce giants. Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple's director of joint venture partnership, told CoinDesk: 
 ""China is a key market for a global payments network, which is why we are looking to build a presence there. Total cross-border [business-to-business] payment value involving China is $5 trillion annually, and the large Chinese e-commerce market currently lacks a highly efficient and low-cost solution."" Most recently, Ripple added 10 new financial institutions to its blockchain network, including MUFG in Japan, BBVA in Spain and SEB in Sweden, but membership by Chinese firms has so far been absent. And it appears it will have to keep working on adding a big name from China to that impressive list of collaborators. Ripple also put to rest speculation that Alibaba was already running a validator node on the Ripple network. Images in the post showed a node that appeared to be operating in Hangzhou, China, with an address linking it to Alibaba Advertising Co., Ltd. This led some to believe the Chinese mammoth would help Ripple maneuver its way into the country, though a Ripple spokesperson said such an effort is not in the works: ""Alibaba (the company) is not running a validator.""

2017-08-17 13:59:00,Ripple,coindesk,Lightning Bank Ledgers? Bitfury and Ripple Demo New Twist on Bitcoin Tech - CoinDesk,"Bitcoin's much-anticipated Lightning Network is now compatible with seven different payment networks. Today, blockchain services firm Bitfury and payments network provider Ripple are releasing new code that makes it possible to conduct Lightning-style transactions across a range of both blockchain and legacy payment networks. While still in its early stages of deployment, it's believed the Lightning Network could one day expand bitcoin's capacity to millions of transactions by moving those transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain. However, today's news arguably goes a step further, adding weight to the idea that the top-layer payments network isn't just a tool for bitcoin. The two companies released a demo showcasing how the new technology can be used to make a transaction between bitcoin and litecoin, the two blockchain networks which have arguably made the most progress in developing the Lightning Network. 
 Since Lightning is increasingly perceived as a necessary layer for blockchain transactions, the companies view this as a big step toward a future where users won't have to worry about which payment method they're using. Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas told CoinDesk: ""I shouldn't have to care which particular coin you use or like. If you're on PayPal and I'm on Alipay or if I'm on bitcoin and you're using a bank account, I'll still be able to send you money and not worry about it. That's the long-term goal."" Honing in on Ripple and Bitfury's work more specifically, the companies have released code that integrates the Lightning Network with Interledger, a protocol designed by Ripple for making transactions between different types of blockchains. This means it's compatible not only with public blockchains like bitcoin or ethereum, but with permissioned protocols managed by only a few companies, as well as traditional payment methods such as PayPal. Interledger aims to support transactions between all of these services by offering a type of ""payment-agnostic"" escrow service. The W3C initiative made its first successful transaction across these various types of payment methods earlier this summer, but the new part here is that the Lightning Network can now sit on top of this infrastructure. ""Lightning natively supports transactions across different blockchains, but it cannot make transactions to any central ledger or to PayPal. That's why integration of Interledger is very, very useful for Lightning,"" said Bitfury researcher Viacheslav Zhygulin. Because litecoin and bitcoin already support test versions of the Lightning Network, the group successfully tested transactions using the LND Lightning Network implementation from Lightning Labs. (And, you can try it out using the open-source software, too.) Right now, it only works on the ""testnet,"" a sandbox version of the blockchain used to trial new features and applications, but Thomas said that the functionality will work similarly on mainnet (the live bitcoin network) once it's safe to deploy it there. In the process of developing the product, the two companies also developed a different testnet - what Thomas called a ""permanent testnet for testnets"" - that cuts across different blockchains as well. Still, while the technology has now been released, there's work to be done to make the technology usable. For example, there are currently no Lightning Network implementations deployed on top of permissioned blockchains that could take advantage of this newfound interoperability. Bitfury representatives argued, though, that the framework sets up the necessary infrastructure for the future. Additionally, Thomas noted that future success of the protocol depends on how many clients ultimately choose to adopt Interledger and Lightning Network technology. Still, the two companies described it as a big step towards moving money across different types of payment networks. And, since bitcoin and litecoin have near-completed Lightning Networks to work on the mainnet, it might not be long before users make real transactions between the two. Longer-term, Thomas indicated that the goal is to move beyond the payment networks that Interledger currently supports to encompass perhaps all of them. He concluded: ""After being involved in the community for so long, I've found that the missing ingredient - the one thing that's missing - is interoperability. Not just with the blockchain, but with central ledgers and more generally interoperability in the financial system.""

2017-08-21 09:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Hints and Rumors? How Ripple Might Really Enter China's Market - CoinDesk,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers. In this opinion piece, Acheson discusses one of the industry's best-funded startups, Ripple, and how it might seek to enter the Chinese market. When word started circulating last week that Alibaba might be running a Ripple validator node, a key question emerged - could this be the blockchain company's road into China? The answer, it seems, is both yes and no. While Ripple denied the rumors, it did confirm that it was looking to break into the Chinese market. 
 On the surface, neither statement is surprising. Of course, Ripple wants to break into China. Any fintech-related business would, given its massive size and high connectivity. And if Alibaba (or, more likely, a division) were running a node, it would make sense to keep quiet about it to avoid a speculative frenzy that would push up the price of the token, which could in turn affect the terms of any deal. The thing is, just because Alibaba isn't running a node, doesn't mean that the companies aren't talking. In fact, a partnership between Ripple and Alibaba makes a lot of sense - and not just for the two companies that would be involved. For Ripple, a San Francisco-based startup that has raised nearly $100 million to disrupt global messaging consortium Swift, the target is tempting. As China's push into global trade intensifies, so do the pain points for cross-border payments, including capital controls, fast-changing regulation and relatively high costs. What's more, the strong growth of China's cross border e-commerce - now at almost 20% of total foreign trade - further fuels demand for cheap and fast currency flows. Forging a relationship with any of China's large banks, however, will be tricky, given the heavy influence of the state and its reluctance to involve foreigners in its financial system. An affiliation with one of the internet giants, with their technology-first focus and their access to a sizeable user base, would be a much more efficient entry into the market. Yet, while the large internet companies have their own financial arms (and could be considered banks), their businesses are largely consumer-facing, while Ripple's operations revolve around bank-to-bank transfers. However, CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently said that he expected Ripple to break into the consumer market within five years. Where better than the largest consumer market in the world? A partnership to explore more efficient clearing in one division could be just the tip of the iceberg. Given Alibaba's sprawling structure and global ambition, blockchain technology has potential applications in many areas of its business, and in-depth work is already going on. Of all the conglomerate's businesses, however, it is perhaps affiliate Ant Financial that offers the most obvious short-term opportunity for Ripple. In a recent interview, its CEO confirmed that it is looking into blockchain technology to underpin Alipay, which dominates China's $5.5 trillion mobile payments sector. Another potential focus of collaboration could be Alibaba's electronic global trading platform, announced last year. Starting with Malaysia, the aim is to forge a network of bilateral links between China and sovereign trading partners, facilitating logistics, negotiating favorable tariffs and (take note) providing a platform for cross-currency electronic payments. But, other parties could also emerge as champions of such a deal. For example, moves by the Chinese regulators reveal an urgent need for transparency. Last week, the People's Bank of China mandated that all third-party mobile payments be cleared through a central platform by next June, to allow greater access to payment data and to keep an eye out for illicit movements. This trend is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future - on the contrary. It does, however, add layers of cost that a blockchain platform could mitigate. Ripple's solution could offer a means of settlement that bypassed central clearing, while still allowing the regulators to monitor flows. Given the obvious strategic benefit, it is likely that the main parties involved are at least talking. Whether cultural, economic and technological barriers can be overcome, however, is another matter. Should exploration go ahead, it would be a big step forward in blockchain development globally. It would also boost cross-border transactions... and relationships.

2017-08-22 18:29:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple's XRP Price Climbs 40% on Surge in Korean Trading - CoinDesk,"The price of XRP is up more than 40 percent in the past 24 hours, a move that comes amid a period of heightened volume in global cryptocurrency markets. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that of XRP - the cryptocurrency of the Ripple network - is trading between $0.23 and $0.24. Much of the trading volume, over $1 billion in the last day, has occurred on exchanges that offer Korean won trading pairs. Bithumb accounts for roughly 44 percent of the global market's activity at press time (reporting more than $500 million in volume), followed by Coinone and Korbit. All told, those exchanges make up just over 70 percent of the past day's total XRP volume. XRP's price is still below the market high hit in May, when the cryptocurrency's price exceeded $0.33. On the other hand, CoinMarketCap data indicates that the last 24 hours have seen the most volume recorded for XRP in a single day. 
 Other cryptocurrencies have seen in excess of $1 billion in trading volume, including both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Bitcoin is trading at approximately $4,069 according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), and bitcoin cash's price is at an average of $635 at press time.

2017-08-24 20:18:00,Ripple,coindesk,"Bernanke, Berners-Lee to Headline Ripple's 'Sibos-Killer' Conference - CoinDesk","Distributed ledger startup Ripple is stepping up its attempt to disrupt Swift, the infrastructure provider that today connects over 11,000 banks around the world. On the same day, in the same city as Swift's flagship event Sibos, Ripple has announced it will host Swell, an event also aimed at bringing the world's financial leaders together to network and discuss trends and strategies. But while similar attempts might fall short for some startups, what could set Ripple's event apart is its stakeholder buy-in. Keynoting the three-day conference in October is none other than the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, Ben Bernanke, and the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee. Taken together, the competing events represent an opportunity of sorts for attendees, many of whom could do business with Ripple and Swift, to cast a vote about their interest. 
 Ripple vice president of marketing Monica Long said Ripple still intends to be a sponsor of Sibos, and will continue to host a vendor booth there, but that the startup's aspirations were bigger than the vendor platform. Long said: ""Our vision for what we could do as an exhibitor exceeded what we could do on the floor at Sibos. The ideas that we had in mind around programming, you can't accomplish that on a show floor in a booth."" Prior to speaking at Swell, Bernanke was among blockchain's early supporters, writing in 2013 that the technology behind cryptocurrencies might hold ""long-term promise."" Likewise, Berners-Lee has long been rumored to be exploring the technology. Other Swell speakers listed as confirmed include the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, the managing director of GE Capital's treasury operations, Kristen Michaud and the head of innovation at Banco Santander, Ed Metzger. To be held in Toronto, Canada, Swell will take place from October 16 to October 18. While this year's Swell won't provide vendor-booth opportunities similar to Sibos, Long said that could change. She concluded: ""I don't know what the future will hold for this."" Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

2018-02-12 17:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,UAE Remittance Firm Partners With DLT Startup Ripple - CoinDesk,"A remittance firm based in Abu Dhabi has inked a new partnership with distributed ledger startup Ripple. UAE Exchange will use the company's RippleNet product for cross-border transactions, with the aim of reducing the cost and frictions associated with such transactions. It was reported last year that the company, which says it operates nearly 800 branch locations in 31 countries, was eyeing a deal to use Ripple's technology. In statements, UAE Exchange said it was looking to deploy the tech in a bid to boost its competitive edge in the market for remittances. ""The early adoption of this game-changing technology allows us to offer a competitive service, as it will have an impact on the speed and cost of cross-border transactions,"" Promoth Manghat, the company's chief executive, was quoted as saying by Business Insider. 
 The company will not use Ripple's XRP token as part of its deal. Instead, the exchange will use Ripple's broader technology stack for executing transactions. The UAE Exchange marks the latest firm to sign on with Ripple, which has announced partnerships with firms like LianLian, Santander UK, IDT Corporation, Mercury FX and MoneyGram in recent days. LianLian is also using RippleNet, while Santander UK is utilizing xCurrent, another Ripple product. Mercury FX, IDT Corporation and MoneyGram are all trialing Ripple's xRapid product, which makes use of the company's XRP token.

2018-02-14 16:20:00,Ripple,coindesk,Saudi Central Bank to Test Ripple Payments Tech - CoinDesk,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple has struck a deal with Saudi Arabia's central bank on a pilot program that will see banks in the country trial the company's tech. Announced today, the pilot with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority marks the second central bank to work with the startup, coming after the Bank of England, the U.K.'s central bank, began working with Ripple last year. Word of the latest deal first emerged earlier this week following comments from CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the Blockchain Connect Conference in San Francisco. ""This ground-breaking pilot program is the first of its kind to be launched by a central bank. Participating banks from the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] will use xCurrent to instantly settle payments sent into and out of the country, with greater transparency and lower costs,"" Ripple said. That the banks in Saudi Arabia would look to pilot xCurrent is perhaps unsurprising given recent interest in the Ripple product by other notable financial institutions. Earlier this month, CoinDesk reported that Santander is in the process of rolling out a mobile payments app that uses the xCurrent tech (which does not rely on Ripple's XRP token), with Spain, Brazil, the U.K. and Poland serving as the initial markets for that release. 
 The announcement also comes a day after news emerged that UAE Exchange, a major remittance company in the United Arab Emirates, had signed on to use the startup's RippleNet product to manage cross-border payments. Separate from the Saudi Arabia news are reports about tests being conducted by remittance giant Western Union, which confirmed in an earnings call yesterday that it is piloting the startup's tech. Fortune reported today that, per a spokesperson, the company is testing payments using XRP. ""We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,"" Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. ""And we do test, we do have some tests with Ripple."" Ripple said as far back as 2015 that it was working with Western Union, though the remittance company didn't comment at the time.

2018-02-19 13:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Coinbase. Ripple. Uphold? Greg Kidd Defends His Boldest Bet Yet - CoinDesk,"""I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floatin' around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both."" The well-known quote from the Academy Award-winning movie ""Forrest Gump"" seems to sum up tech investor Greg Kidd's life, and he even says as much himself. Calling an investment opportunity his ""Forrest Gump moment"" - just being in the right place at the right time - Kidd has bumped into, and subsequently invested in, some huge successes in his day. For instance, after founding a bicycle courier service aimed at helping financial institutions more efficiently deliver paper checks, the company was hacked by Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Square, both of which Kidd then put money in. 
 And while working on an early Y-Combinator project that would have allowed people to spend any kind of value on a credit card, Kidd stumbled into Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, in which he also invested. Then, most recently, while looking for an investment opportunity that would let him trade cryptocurrencies more efficiently, Kidd ran into Uphold, a crypto startup that, while under the radar of the media for a couple years, happened to be focused on just that. ""When I arrived [at Uphold's site], it was like I was immediately transported to Star Trek-land, because I saw there were dozens of currencies, including crypto and fiat, but also silver and gold,"" Kidd told CoinDesk. With that, Kidd rather enthusiastically dumped $57 million into Uphold and joined the startup's board in an effort to help the company move forward with its mission. Speaking to that pursuit, Kidd said: ""If you take a look at my investment portfolio ... you'll see probably the top 20 or 30 portfolio companies of mine all stand to benefit or support Uphold in its effort."" In interview, Kidd detailed a number of projects in his portfolio that are in various stages of development that could benefit from work with Uphold. The most advanced of these efforts appear to be a crypto credit card. Specifically, Kidd mentioned that Shift Payments might be able to let Uphold customers spend their holdings almost anywhere major credit cards are accepted. ""Imagine enabling Uphold to issue cards to all of its members, so any of those 40-plus currencies that they support could be spent anywhere that Visa or Mastercard is accepted,"" Kidd said. Shift Payments has already launched similar cards with Coinbase and Dwolla, and last year revealed a project with PayPal-owned Venmo. Kidd continued: ""That's just like an obvious slam dunk integration."" Although, for all Kidd's enthusiasm, vice-chairman of Uphold, JP Thieriot, took a more measured tone. Thieriot clarified that while Uphold has plans to release a multi-purpose credit card later this year, it's still ""exploring"" opportunities and hadn't necessarily settled on Shift Payments as the provider of that product. Still, Kidd mentioned other projects, including a partnership between Uphold and blockchain identity startup Global ID, of which Kidd is both founder and CEO. According to Kidd, Global ID could make it easier for companies using Uphold's APIs to verify user identities easier. Plus, Kidd, who has invested in Ripple too, indicated that he'd like to see the addition of XRP, Ripple's native cryptocurrency, added to the Uphold platform. Although, true to form, Thieriot downplayed this move a bit, stating that Uphold might add XRP, but that's a long ways from an official announcement. But even with Thieriot softening Kidd's promotion, Kidd has staked a personal investment in the company which seems tailor-made to ensure his interests and the interests of Uphold align. Of the total investment, 45 percent will come in the form of an exchange of Uphold equity for cash, 20 percent comes in the form of a licensing agreement and 35 percent comes from Kidd putting up a portion of his current portfolio balance sheet. The latter part is perhaps the most interesting in that the exposure to the assets is designed to protect Uphold against any number of scenarios where the company might deal with a significant negative event, such as being hacked. ""I'm willing to pledge a certain amount of my balance sheet, or the balance sheet of my venture company - a lot of that is tied up in crypto - as a reserve,"" Kidd said. Plus, Kidd has committed to collaborating on development. Specifically, Thieriot said some of the funds will be used for the creation of a research and development lab to streamline new and existing projects. ""One of the immediate upshots of this collaboration is the formation of Uphold Labs, in which [Kidd] will be active,"" said Thieriot. ""[Kidd] is aware of the existing pipeline of projects which is pretty deep and interesting, and he'll have at least bi-weekly involvement in moving that forward."" Perhaps one of the main reasons Kidd is so gung-ho about Uphold is the fact that the company is already making money. Originally founded in 2014 as BitReserve, last year the company became profitable for the first time, according to Thieriot, six months ahead of schedule. While the company has kept a low profile, it's business seems to have grown substantially. According to Uphold's site, the company has transacted $2.8 billion in volume from six million transactions. Coupled with its profitability, Uphold's business transparency also drove Kidd's final decision to not only invest, but put so much skin in the game. For instance, far exceeding the 10 percent of liabilities required to be held by all large financial institutions by the Federal Reserve, Uphold shows a reserve status of 101.7 percent of its liabilities, or $164 million. The reserve funds include multiple tiers of assets, including $30 million in U.S. dollars, $1.8 million in gold and $50 million in bitcoin. ""They're prepared to scale, they're doing it in a compliant way, and they're doing it in the U.S.,"" said Kidd, adding: ""Over the past year, they went from growing very quickly to not making any money to basically being pretty much in the black every day, and quite in the black everyday.""

2018-02-21 15:05:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Adds 5 New Clients Across 4 Countries - CoinDesk,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple has today announced new partnerships with five banking and money transfer institutions across four different countries. Going forward, the two banks - Itaú Unibanco from Brazil and IndusInd from India - along with money remittance companies InstaReM from Singapore, Beetech from Brazil and Zip Remit from Canada, will be adopting different Ripple platforms to facilitate real-time international payments, according to a  press release. While Beetech and Zip Remit plan to use Ripple's xVia product to facilitate international payment corridors aimed at individual customers, IndusInd, InstaReM and Itaú Unibanco plan to use xCurrent for real-time international transactions to financial institutions, according to  Finextra. In addition, both Beetech and Zip Remit plan to ultimately create a working relationship with China-based LianLian, which recently began using xCurrent. 
 The move will also help Ripple, said InstaReM CEO Prajit Nanu, as the blockchain startup's other members will now be able to take advantage of the payment company's growing network. ""Now, RippleNet members will be able to process a large number of payouts in Southeast Asian countries through InstaReM's secure rails,"" he said. Ripple's head of business development, Patrick Griffin, added that the new partnerships will particularly assist customers in emerging markets, explaining: ""Whether it's a teacher in the U.S. sending money home to his family in Brazil or a small business owner in India trying to move money to open up a second store in another country, it's imperative that we connect the world's financial institutions into a payments system that works for their customers, not against them.""

2018-02-21 16:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Papers Pledge New Start for $40 Billion XRP - CoinDesk,"The startup that oversees development of the world's third most-valuable cryptocurrency, XRP, is moving to upgrade the underlying technology on which it operates. Announced Wednesday, San Francisco-based startup Ripple is releasing two new white papers for peer review - one describing XRP's consensus algorithm in a more formal way and the other outlining a way to improve the diversity of connections of each node, the software users run to relay and verify transactions on the network. Taken together, the moves show that Ripple, whose investors include banks like Santander and SBI, is ready and willing to invest in the core infrastructure supporting its cryptocurrency, which despite falling out of favor with the company at times, now secures more than $40 billion in value. Yet, while XRP has become one of the most in-demand crypto assets, in some ways its development has lagged behind other more established offerings like bitcoin and ether. 
 Indeed, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas sought to portray the papers as a step towards developing a tighter relationship between the company's research arm and academia. In short, the startup wants it to be easier for researchers to follow Ripple's technology, so its easier for them to contribute. In interview, Thomas sought to stress how the papers open up the possibility of further building a network effect around the tech - one that might be key now that traders are buying in. Thomas told CoinDesk: ""This is the first time we're releasing peer-reviewed academic papers. Obviously, it opens the door for future research. After this, I expect you'll hear much more about us interacting with academia."" More broadly, the papers can be seen as perhaps the first attempt in some time for the company to refresh and improve documentation around the open-source platform. (The work is the first since 2014 to detail the XRP Ledger, then called the Ripple Consensus Ledger.) As such, the papers are also a statement on the continuing evolution of Ripple, which after launching with the goal of repurposing cryptocurrency into a secure payments network is seeking to replace centralized bank messaging and liquidity services with decentralized alternatives. For Thomas, however, the two releases have one central theme: security. ""What we're trying to do here is add some defenses against some unlikely attack scenarios. Basically, it says you can't completely manipulate the entire network,"" he explained. The key word here is ""unlikely."" Thomas argues these attack vectors aren't viable unless the attacker was a state actor, say the U.S. government, with enough money and technological resources to disrupt the network. And though he isn't particularly worried about this happening, Thomas said the startup is trying to protect against those use cases anyway. ""We're extremely cautious. We want the best security,"" he added. The first paper, called ""Analysis of the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol"" builds on the company's 2014 paper, providing a formal, mathematical proof that what's supposed to happen on the network will really happen. It boils down to two things: ""safety,"" that the network won't fork into two competing networks, and ""liveness,"" that the network won't get stuck and will keep processing transactions. The second paper, ""Cobalt: BFT Governance in Open Networks"" seeks to improve on previous XRP plans with an algorithm that supports a richer array of validators. You can think of XRP as kind of like a voting system, where each node storing Ripple's transaction history gets a vote on what happens next. To help it accomplish this, each node in Ripple carries something called a Unique Node List (UNL), a list of nodes on the Ripple network that the node considers legitimate. So, if each node is connecting to a better variety of nodes, the argument goes, that's good for the long-term resiliency and decentralization of the network. Both papers draw heavily on distributed systems, a body of computer science research describing how large connected networks function. And because they're more theoretical, Thomas stressed these papers will likely have a longer-term impact. ""It's not going to affect how users use XRP right now. They won't experience any downtime or anything,"" he said. Still, it will remain to be seen if Ripple's developments, including these papers, are enough to allay criticisms of Ripple and its arguably hot-and-cold relationship with XRP. It's worth noting there are some who have been skeptical of its tech from the beginning, and that these criticisms have only grown as XRP has seen more attention. Critics are often supporters of other blockchains, like bitcoin or ethereum, which seek to use decentralization in a different way. (Some even going as far as to argue the technology ""serves no purpose"" as an alternative to today's global, financial technology.) Thomas, though, is unfazed by these negative assessments. In statements, he sought to position critics as out of touch, while remarking that the nature of the technology is that it can improve and respond to market needs. ""Critics are always one step behind,"" Thomas told CoinDesk. ""When I started at Ripple, all sorts of things didn't happen. It wasn't open-source, we didn't have validators, but over time it's grown and we've been able to accomplish all of these things."" In this way, Thomas sees the papers as just another way Ripple is responding to market needs, whether that's ensuring it's providing an alternative to SWIFT or that its cryptocurrency is secure. As Thomas views it, curbing centralization of validation is what they're working on next, even going as far as to argue that Ripple will be ""far more decentralized"" than bitcoin in the future.

2018-03-01 12:59:00,Ripple,coindesk,Payment Provider Fleetcor to Pilot Ripple's XRP Cryptocurrency - CoinDesk,"Workforce and fleet payments provider Fleetcor Technologies has become the latest to trial Ripple's xRapid product, which utilizes its custom cryptocurrency XRP. Canada-based financial consultants Cambridge Global Payments, which Fleetcor acquired last year, will also be part of the partnership, a Ripple spokesperson said. Cambridge has been a Ripple client since 2017, though it has largely used the startup's xCurrent product. Stepping back, the news comes over a month after telecom provider IDT and payments provider Mercury signed on to pilot xRapid. Similarly, MoneyGram soon after revealed it was piloting the same product to test its speed and efficiency for international payments, as previously reported. At present, the companies must use pre-funded bank accounts in various countries in order to facilitate transactions. 
 Cuallix, a Mexican financial services company, has been using XRP as an alternative since last year, and noted in a recent blog post that the liquidity provided by xRapid helps it process direct payments between the U.S. and its southern neighbor both quickly and cheaply. Various other companies have also signed on with Ripple in recent months, using its blockchain technology stacks, but not XRP, to ease cross-border transactions.

2018-03-02 08:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,South Korean Bank Trials Ripple for Overseas Remittances - CoinDesk,"South Korea's Woori Bank has reportedly completed a cross-border remittance test using the distributed ledger technology (DLT) developed by San Fransisco-based startup Ripple. According to local business media source ChosunBiz, the completion of the trial arrives as the bank's Digital Strategy Department reveals plans to commercialize the Ripple-based platform this year. It also marks a second phase of the trial, following an earlier test at the end of January. The bank's participation in piloting DLT payments comes as part of a wider effort that has seen another 60 or so Japanese banks also joining trials initiated by Japan's SBI Group, the report says. Previously, SBI Ripple Asia - a joint venture between Ripple and financial giant SBI -  said in September last year that it would begin testing cross-border remittances over Ripple's solution between Japanese and South Korean banks by the end of 2017. The aim of the effort being to bring DLT into real-life use and bringing new efficiencies to banks' cross-border transactions by cutting middlemen banks out of the equation. 
 According the September report, the group involved notable banks from Japan, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group. ChosunBiz indicates that other non-Japanese institutions involved include South Korea's Woori and Shinhan banks, as well as Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank.

2018-03-04 11:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,How XRP Fits Into Ripple's Payments Products Explained - CoinDesk,"Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP, are having a moment. Winning the attention of new investors (so much so that XRP shot up over 1,000 percent earlier this year) as well as new clients (with announcements rolling out at a slow and steady clip), the enterprise blockchain startup has been the talk of crypto in 2018. Yet, newcomers should note that much of the enthusiasm stems from certain claims by the startup - namely, that its tech could revolutionize international payments, innovating on outdated methods for routing messages and money between financial behemoths. Not only does Ripple claim its products are cheaper and faster, but it also touts them as generally more efficient than the services in the marketplace today, a claim that hinges primarily on its use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. 
 Still, not all Ripple products are created equal in relation to XRP and its $35 billion market. In fact, XRP, the asset you can buy and trade, is just one small piece of a suite of products the San Francisco startup offers (some of which don't employ the cryptocurrency at all). In the following piece, we outline Ripple's three products today - xCurrent, xRapid and xVia - and explain where XRP fits in.  Built on a distributed ledger called Interledger, xCurrent doesn't operate on the same technology as XRP (which uses a separate system called XRP Ledger). Of note is that, while Interledger was built by Ripple executives, it's not managed by the company - it's incubating in a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) group, which is managed by a long-standing non-profit dedicated to furthering internet standards. As such, the main goal of xCurrent is to provide interoperability between any and all currencies, not just cryptocurrencies. By having connectors that hold value in a number of currencies, xCurrent allows banks to transact with each other, even if the sender wants to pay in U.S. dollars but the recipient wants to receive money in euros. The product also features a messaging platform ""used to coordinate information exchange between the banks,"" Thomas said, one that lets either bank send data back and forth. The messaging platform allows for real-time updates so that simple errors, such as mistakes in spelling the recipient's name, don't delay payments from getting facilitated quickly. Another function allows payments to be tracked to their endpoint, all while preserving customer privacy. As Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas explains: ""It provides a single source of truth for the transacting counterparties while preserving the privacy of banking customers' identifiable payment information."" So, while some of the hype surrounding XRP had to do with xCurrent customers, the product itself doesn't rely on cryptocurrency necessarily. The same way that xCurrent can handle dollars, euros and other fiat currencies as well as bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies, XRP can be traded through the system.  However, when XRP is traded through the xCurrent system, Ripple defines that as a new product called xRapid. As the year has progressed, a number of existing and new Ripple customers have come forward to express their interest in experimenting with the use of XRP through xRapid. Simply put, xRapid is a liquidity solution. Companies can swap assets in and out of XRP in order to move it through Ripple's xCurrent payment protocol faster. In short, this means these companies would create demand for XRP on the public market. And while the product supports other cryptocurrencies, XRP is said to have express advantages. Thomas told CoinDesk: ""While other digital assets could technically be applied, XRP is quicker and cheaper - at fractions of a penny and about three seconds per transaction."" Large remittance providers, such as Western Union and Moneygram, have begun piloting xRapid in their businesses; so have a handful of others. While only one company - Cuallix - has begun using xRapid in live real-money transactions, Ripple tweeted in January that ""three of the top five"" global money transfer companies might soon follow its lead. (This set off a familiar chorus from doubters, who say banks won't ever embrace cryptocurrency). Still, Thomas remains confident that xRapid would become more attractive to financial institutions around the world. ""What drives value is usage,"" Thomas said, ""a quantifiable way to look at that is like how much liquidity is going through the token. So, I think that's like the name of the game here, it's trying to get as much liquidity through it, and the more liquidity, the more value, and that's what we're trying to do."" For Ripple, xRapid represents the final stage of a consortium effort called RippleNet, where XRP is the central asset connecting all of its disparate payment protocols. Thomas told CoinDesk: ""As a store of value, as something that we're are very much invested in the outcome of the doctrine of XRP, by virtue of our holding of XRP, we are obviously believers in the long-term potential for XRP to rise in value as adoption improves.""  Having said that, Ripple is also interested in moving clients to its xVia product, a payment interface designed to make the user experience of xCurrent and xRapid more intuitive. In the same way that WhatsApp hides the complex inner-workings of online instant messaging with a slick user interface, xVia looks to mask the complexity of facilitating payments through Ripple's other products. As such, xVia does not use the company's cryptocurrency XRP by default, though that is an option. Just as xCurrent allows users to track payments, xVia does the same, allowing users to generate invoices of their transactions. While it's the last stage of Ripple's product ecosystem, a couple remittance providers - Brazil-based Beetech and Canada-based Zip Remit - have announced plans to use the product. Yet, there still seems to be confusion about what the product itself is, with a rep on Reddit explaining it's the facilitator of the payments themselves. This likely stems not only from the overlap all of Ripple's products have with each other but also the fact that little is said, at this point, about xVia.

2018-03-05 12:20:00,Ripple,coindesk,Over $1: XRP Rises As Ripple-Coinbase Rumors Renew - CoinDesk,"The price of the third-largest cryptocurrency by total value is up 16 percent Monday, buoyed by speculation it could soon see a major exchange listing. Indeed, comments on social media indicate investors now expect XRP price to extend Monday's gains ahead of an alleged appearance by CEO Brad Garlinghouse on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" Tuesday. Also said to be on the program is Coinbase COO Asiff Hirji, a possible coincidence that's raising conjecture the major U.S. exchange will add support for XRP trading. Currently, Coinbase offers trading for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ether, meaning the addition of XRP could enable a new outlet for retail trading. Still, while details about the appearance are scant (it's not clear if the two will be appearing together, and neither has tweeted plans for the show), XRP is trading at $1.05, having appreciated 16 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data provider CoinMarketCap. 
 Yet another potential driver is a surge in South Korean trading volumes, with four out of top 10 exchanges by trading volumes being based in the Asian nation. Indeed, Bithumb, in particular, has seen its XRP trading surge more than 30 percent on the day. The rumor mill might keep XRP well bid for another 24 hours. That said, the price chart analysis indicates better days ahead of the XRP token.  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows: The only factor that could be listed as the one favoring the bears is the bearish 50-day MA and 10-day MA crossover. However, long-term moving average crossovers are lagging indicators. So, XRP looks set to take out the descending trendline (drawn from the Jan. 28 high and Feb. 17 high) resistance.

2018-03-05 21:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,"'No Decision' on New Assets, Coinbase Says Amid Ripple Rumors - CoinDesk","U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is pushing back against rumors it may soon add Ripple's XRP token to its existing trading pairs. The speculation originated after it was revealed that Coinbase chief operating officer and president Asiff Hirji would appear alongside Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse on a special episode of CNBC's ""Fast Money"" program on March 6. And despite any hard evidence of the presumed listing, the price of XRP rose to over $1 on Monday on the news. Following hours of radio silence on the issue, Coinbase took to Twitter to quell the rumors, stating that a January statement about listing new cryptocurrencies - which details how a ""committee of internal experts"" ultimately makes those decisions - hadn't changed. Our January 4th, 2018 statement continues to stand: we have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. 
 Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company. https://t.co/X04oN6BcGp — Coinbase (@coinbase) March 5, 2018  As for the planned CNBC segment, it's not entirely clear at this time whether Garlinghouse and Hirji will speak on a panel together or appear separately. Host Melissa Lee tweeted a screenshot of a promo for the crypto-themed segment earlier today, which also lists Passport Capital founder John Burbank and Social Capital founder and CEO Chamath Palihapitiya. A spokesperson for Ripple declined to comment on the rumors when reached. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple and Coinbase.

2018-03-07 08:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Japanese Banks to Harness Ripple DLT for Consumer Payments App - CoinDesk,"A group of Japanese banks is planning to use Ripple's blockchain-based payments technology in a forthcoming product aimed at general consumers. According to an announcement on Tuesday by the San Francisco-based startup, Japan's SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank will launch a smartphone application in autumn this year, dubbed MoneyTap, that will be powered by Ripple's distributed ledger technology (DLT). Ripple said the new application will allow customers of the three banks to initiate domestic transactions 24 hours a day and seven days a week. It further states that by using a bank account or phone number, or by scanning QR codes, users can make instant transactions without the usual the time constraints imposed by traditional bank transfers. Currently, the three banks - all members of the Japan Bank Consortium led by SBI Ripple Asia - appear to be in the first phase of testing the product. Following its launch later this year, the smartphone service is planned to be rolled out to the other 61 Japanese bank members of the consortium, according to the announcement. 
 The news marks the latest move by SBI Ripple Asia - a joint venture launched by Ripple and Japan's financial giant SBI Holdings - in bringing blockchain-powered remittances to consumers, following its recent existing exploration of cross-border transactions between banks. As reported by CoinDesk, SBI Ripple Asia has already initiated blockchain pilots using Ripple's DLT system in sending transaction between financial institutions in Japan and South Korea. Most recently, South Korea's Woori Bank became one of a number of worldwide institutions to have also trialed Ripple's payments product in making overseas transactions.

2018-03-13 11:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Thai Bank Extending Ripple Remittances to Euro and Pound - CoinDesk,"Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) is adding two new currencies to its Ripple-based blockchain remittance platform. According to a report from the Bangkok Post on Tuesday, SCB, one of the largest commercial banks in the country, is now adding euros and British pounds to its cross-border remittance system powered by tech from Ripple, the San Francisco-based blockchain startup. According to the bank's chief strategy officer, Arak Sutivong, in an interview with the Post, the decision to add the new currency options came after the SCB noticed significant euro and pound inflow to the country. With the update to be completed by the third quarter of this year, Arak said the two new currencies will initially be focused on inbound remittance for retail customers through collaboration with banking members within the Ripple network. 
 The plan adds to the existing Japanese yen remittance option that is being tested by the bank as part of a wider effort from a consortium of over 60 Japanese and South Korean banks in piloting Ripple's blockchain settlement solution. In fact, the bank said it had been conducting remittance trials since June of last year, allowing Thais in Japan to send funds back to their home country, through a sandbox approach under the oversight of the Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank. Currently waiting for approval to exit the sandbox, SCB said the new additions to its existing remittance option may not need to go through the experiment process again, since the technological aspects of the platform remain unchanged.

2018-03-20 12:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple's XRP Might Be the Next Big Crypto Futures Market - CoinDesk,"Bitcoin futures may have been launched with tremendous fanfare - but XRP futures, on the other hand, not so much. In fact, U.K.-based startup Crypto Facilities has been operating a futures market for the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, developed by blockchain startup Ripple Inc., for almost 18 months now. And while the company's CEO, Timo Schlaefer, has been tight-lipped about the product so far, he sees trends in recent data that indicate broader XRP futures adoption may be on the horizon. ""We have pretty good order books,"" Schlaefer told CoinDesk, ""And we're in the process of working with some of the large market makers to draw that further."" Indeed, when bitcoin was still months away from getting its first Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated bitcoin derivatives, Schlaefer's company had quietly partnered with Ripple and launched XRP futures - its second cryptocurrency futures product after bitcoin to be regulated under the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
 Later, when Chicago commodities giants Cboe and CME Group opened their first bitcoin futures in December, Crypto Facilities' own XRP futures were trading $14.2 million in volume a month. And by the time Cboe's first bitcoin futures contract expired in January, Crypto Facilities' XRP futures had almost doubled in volume to $24.6 million. Yet, few outside the firm's own pool of investors even knew the futures were being traded, much less with that kind of volume. Now, that appears to be changing with the company on track for another positive month, and others exploring the contracts. ""The liquidity has been growing quite a lot,"" Schlaefer said, adding: ""We have seen our volume growing through February and expect March to set a new record."" While Schlaefer wouldn't reveal the identities of the large market makers the company is currently courting, data he provided exclusively to CoinDesk gives a look into how the offering has been growing - and it largely mirrors the price of XRP itself. For instance, the volume of cash-settled XRP futures, which the company officially launched in October 2016, were relatively flat from month to month until March 2017. That's when XRP futures volume more than tripled to $3.08 million and quadrupled to $12.1 million the following month. Over the same time period, the price of XRP experienced similar growth, rising from $0.03 in April to $0.34 in mid-May, before shrinking substantially. But then again in January 2018, the volume of futures mirrored XRP's price increases, jumping to $24.6 million as the price of the cryptocurrency reached a record $3.53.  And according to Schlaefer, while the number of registered investors in XRP futures, between 2,000 and 3,000 people, seems small, he estimates that those investing in the product comprise about 30 percent of Crypto Facilities' total number of investors. With most of those trading falling into the category of retail investors, XRP also represents a growth opportunity for the company, and Schlaefer believes, the industry at large. ""We still want to get them a more diverse user base,"" he said. 'But it's going in the right direction."" And there's reason to believe more products could be on the horizon. Already, CME Group, valued at $55 billion, has set a precedent of working with Crypto Facilities in the build-up to its own bitcoin futures launch. While a representative of CME Group declined to comment on whether the company is exploring XRP futures specifically, it participated in Ripple's $55 million Series B investment in 2016. Shortly thereafter, the former head of precious metals and metals options at CME Group also joined Ripple as its head of XRP markets. Cboe has also been non-committal in its answers to queries. In response to CoinDesk's inquiry about XRP futures, a Cboe spokesperson reiterated statements from the company's chief executive, who last year said the exchange was open to adding additional cryptocurrency options. But it may be startups focused on the use case that are the first to finally embrace XRP. Paul Chou, the co-founder and CEO of LedgerX, a CFTC-regulated bitcoin derivatives provider, said his company was exploring the possibility of XRP futures. LedgerX launched the first regulated and physically-settled bitcoin derivatives product last year and has since traded $100 million in notional volume. Still, Chou hinted at reservations that could slow adoption. For example, he said that the company's decision on whether to add XRP futures will stem primarily from its analysis of XRP's ""concentration of holdings."" Indeed, the reason for LedgerX's concern reflects apprehension more broadly held within the cryptocurrency community about Ripple Inc. and its control over XRP. For one, Ripple's employees reportedly hold large amounts of the cryptocurrency. As such, in response to demand from customers ""who are definitely inquiring about XRP,"" Chou said, the company established a group to investigate. In particular, the group is looking into the potential that those that who hold large amounts of XRP could manipulate the price, especially if the futures contracts are settled in cash. Chou concluded: ""Physical settlement avoids those issues because you are not beholden to some abstract price that might or might not be manipulated. You either want the crypto, or you don't.""

2018-03-28 14:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,Uphold Adds Buy and Sell Options for Ripple's XRP - CoinDesk,"Digital payments startup Uphold announced Wednesday that it has added support for Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency. XRP joins Uphold's existing list of currencies and cryptocurrencies that can be bought or traded, with bitcoin, ethereum and bitcoin cash, among others, already on the menu. According to vice chairman J.P. Thieriot, the move follows a Twitter poll earlier this month that indicated XRP was the most-desired token to be added, taking 51 percent of just over 12,000 votes. It also comes following a $57.5. million investment from former Ripple chief risk officer Greg Kidd in January, and Uphold's acquisition of mobile commerce platform Cortex MCP a month later. Uphold has been working on integrating XRP for roughly a month, said Thieriot, who explained: 
 ""Generally we have to find counterparties we can trade with, given our system, [since] we don't have an internal orderbook. We have to create an integration with a third party. In the case of XRP, it's an entirely new blockchain - it's not like adding an ERC-20 token, which is relatively trivial for us."" XRP can be exchanged with no fees being charged, and can be traded or used in transactions across Uphold's existing offerings, according to statements. These include seven cryptocurrencies and 23 fiat currencies, on top of four precious metals. According to Uphold, the next phase of support involves integrating with the Ripple network itself, enabling direct deposits and withdrawals via the mainnet. The company said that this should be rolled out in the next few weeks. XRP token image via Shutterstock

2018-03-28 16:10:00,Ripple,coindesk,Ripple Joins Hyperledger Blockchain Consortium - CoinDesk,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple has joined the Linux Foundation-backed Hyperledger blockchain consortium. Hyperledger announced Wednesday that Ripple is among fourteen companies to join the group, which first launched at the end of 2015 and to date has added more than 200 firms and organizations to its ranks. Also joining the group is CULedger, a separate consortium backed by a group of credit unions that last year formed an industry-focused services company. ""Through our partnership with Hyperledger, developers will be able to access Interledger Protocol (ILP) in Java for enterprise use,"" Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas said in a statement. ILP was previously only operable on JavaScript. However, Ripple entered into a collaboration with Japanese system integration company NTT Data last year to retool the protocol with the Java programming language. 
 The two companies subsequently submitted the revamped Java-based protocol to Hyperledger, under the new moniker Hyperledger Quilt. ""The Hyperledger Quilt project connects Hyperledger blockchains with other ILP-capable payment systems such as XRP Ledger, Ethereum, Bitcoin (Lightning), Litecoin, Mojaloop and RippleNet, helping us to deliver on our vision for an internet of value - where money moves as information does today,"" Thomas explained. 2018 is set to be a busy year for the Hyperledger consortium. It plans to advance three open-source blockchain platforms to version 1.0 or production status, and also intends to launch an enterprise blockchain tool aimed at speeding up the development of blockchain applications.

2018-04-05 13:00:00,Ripple,coindesk,An XRP ICO? It's On Whether Ripple Likes It or Not - CoinDesk,"It turns out, you can launch crypto tokens on Ripple's XRP Ledger, and a small group of coders are seeking to be among the first to do it. Stepping back, that might seem strange on multiple levels. For one, there's XRP Ledger's association with Ripple, the San Francisco startup that has largely tried to distance itself from cryptocurrency, mostly focusing on offering distributed ledger tech to some of the world's largest financial firms. Second, there's the fact that XRP Ledger, while open-source, isn't exactly known as a platform. But while ethereum has been the go-to blockchain for entrepreneurs that want to launch cryptocurrencies, it turns out that lately, a significant number of token issuers have been looking for alternatives. And for Allvor, a small Brazil-based company focused on streamlining digital payments, the XRP Ledger is proving an attractive option for running what it hopes will be a significant token-based business. And they couldn't be more excited. 
 ""The XRP Ledger, which is developed by Ripple Company, is the best and most efficient distributed database technology ever made,"" according to Allvor's white paper, which reads more like a fanzine for the technology. According to the company, XRP Ledger's main selling point is its speed, but there are several other reasons why they think Ripple's distributed ledger is the perfect place for crypto tokens. Still, Ripple seems less thrilled about the idea. In statements, the company sought to emphasize that by nature it can't prevent even exotic uses of its technology due to its open, public codebase. According to a Ripple spokesperson: ""XRP Ledger is open-source and a decentralized platform, so people can build whatever they want, but Ripple isn't interested in promoting or supporting ICOs on the ledger."" And that unenthused response might lead to issues down the line. For one, Allvor understands that to succeed in its mission of streamlining e-commerce it needs a system that does more than just settle transactions. It'll need a system that integrates with merchant's logistics, customer management and marketing software. As such, it's launching a token called ""ALV"" and building a platform that the token interacts with. ""The ideal would be if a merchant of any size could install the software or plugin that makes the ALV payment feasible within 10 minutes,"" said Cleyton Domingues, the co-founder of Allvor and a longtime staffer in Brazil's economy ministry. ""Our challenge will be to develop the software that makes the integration possible."" Yet, the company, which doesn't have investors but instead has bootstrapped the project itself, remains unfazed, primarily because its executive believes XRP Ledger already offers a variety of benefits. For example, Allvor's white paper says that the ledger's ""hybrid payment gateways"" technology will allow them to more easily set up a truly global system. And since users of the ledger have to set up ""trust channels"" with people they'd like to transact with, users will feel like they have more control over what crypto tokens they receive. This is particularly important since recently both retail and institutional investors have lamented the spammy nature of token airdrops, whereby issuers seed users with tokens merely based on the amount of another token - like ether - they have. But Ripple's system means that users will have to opt-in to receive tokens. Allvor is creating 100 billion ALV tokens - with 5 percent being sent to current XRP holders (if they opt-in) based on the amount they held as of March 27. Still, investors may be wary of entering a market that's challenging to exit. Despite XRP's recent surge in popularity (it's now the third largest by market cap), Ripple executives have struggled to entice major U.S. exchanges, like Coinbase and Gemini, to list its native cryptocurrency, according to Bloomberg. Yet, Jon Holmquist, an industry entrepreneur and founder of the Bitcoin Black Friday movement, said that might not matter since Ripple's protocol is designed to work as a decentralized exchange of sorts, capable of representing all kinds of assets. And Holmquist should know - he was actually the first to launch a token on Ripple in June 2017. Through the ICO, Holmquist earned $1,500 in XRP, but after about a month, he decided to refund investor's money to steer clear of the regulatory hammer, following guidance put out by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on The DAO. ""I think a lot of ICOs are hesitant to be the first ones,"" Holmquist told CoinDesk. That said, he expects more entrepreneurs to see the benefits of the XRP Ledger for token issuance even despite the lukewarm reception the concept has received. And there's plenty of untapped potential, he said, adding: ""I think the Ripple community is very strong. You can tap into the network with investors sitting on XRP and nothing to do with it.""

2018-04-08 11:30:00,Ripple,coindesk,Is XRP a Security? Major Ripple Debates Explained - CoinDesk,"What is a ""cryptocurrency?"" Try as Webster dictionary may, a formal definition remains hard to pin down. While it's unclear exactly when the word itself was coined, bitcoin, the world's very first such cryptographically-backed asset, is probably the answer that most often springs to mind. Still, a vast array of very different technologies now carry and use the moniker, and companies, opportunists and investors all seem to have their own version of the word and its meaning. Naturally, some crypto assets have also run afoul of this ever-changing status quo. 
 Perhaps the largest yet to draw this complaint is XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by value and the technology that powers just one of several enterprise banking products offered by San Francisco startup Ripple. Earlier this year, XRP broke out of its sideways trading, moving from around $0.30 to nearly $4. While the price soon after receded, interest in Ripple is larger than ever, with a whole new captured audience cheering on its announcements and partnerships. But as many others are keen to point out, bitcoin and XRP aren't exactly the same. In fact, calling both ""cryptocurrencies,"" to some, would be like calling fruits vegetables. ""Just a friendly reminder. Ripple is not a cryptocurrency,"" BitcoinTalk user ""leopard2"" wrote recently. It's a statement echoed by many others throughout the industry. ""I don't call this cryptocurrency. It's not currency,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said at a Yahoo Finance conference in February. Instead, the company seems to prefer the term ""digital asset."" And that isn't necessarily just smoke and mirrors. Indeed, terms such as token, asset, unit and currency are used indiscriminately throughout the industry. So, while XRP may not fit the definition of cryptocurrency, examining the technology from the lens of this nomenclature and its debates can be helpful in understanding its key features. One of the main criticisms of XRP is that it's not truly ""decentralized."" If you're new to the space, that might not mean much. But, decentralization is a big deal to crypto enthusiasts. In many ways, it's an attribute that separates cryptocurrencies from older online money systems, where a central authority could block or have control over transactions. Supporters of ""decentralized cryptocurrencies"" tout the internet as an example of a decentralized system, in that information moves freely and openly (with some restrictions) and without any central party in the middle operating it. Still, others see centralization as a tradeoff, arguing it's oftentimes too inefficient. Ripple developers readily admit that XRP does things differently and isn't as decentralized as they would like it to be. The debate, then, is not over how centralized Ripple is, but whether it produces a better online money without the same, full decentralization of bitcoin. The argument against XRP: Some argue that XRP doesn't add anything new in the way of innovations in crypto-economics, another buzzword in the nascent field. One often touted sticking point is that Ripple the company selects which nodes validate transactions, compiling what's known as the Unique Node List (UNL). In bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, anyone running the software can perform this action. Indeed, a major cryptocurrency exchange went so far as to call out this point in a research report on Ripple released last month, which argues XRP ""does not serve a clear purpose."" Although Ripple has brought on a range of entities to validate transactions on the network, including the likes of Microsoft and MIT who are now running XRP nodes, critics argue that the way the algorithm is set up, other nodes veer toward trusting Ripple's node, and therefore, the company itself. The argument for Ripple: Ripple developers argue the opposite, that XRP is better than more traditional cryptocurrencies for several reasons: It's faster and more scalable. Plus, it's less expensive to secure than bitcoin's energy-hungry proof-of-work. Ripple chief market executive Cory Johnson went as far as to argue XRP ""demonstrates an intrinsic value"" that stands out among ""sillier"" coins and assets. Not to mention, time and time again, Ripple developers have argued that they plan to decentralize XRP over time, a goal they've chronicled in their company blog. And there's merit to suggest it is. Already, startups are looking to do things with XRP, like launch ICOs, that the company doesn't quite condone. In an earlier interview with CoinDesk, Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas went as far as to contend XRP will be ""more decentralized"" than bitcoin in the future as they add more validators and flesh out the technology. He and other Ripple developers further argue they've delivered on their past promises. Back when XRP wasn't open source, critics argued it would never be. But Ripple open sourced the code for its XRP ""full node,"" meaning it could get more scrutiny from outside developers and users could for the first time use to operate to join the network in 2013, seen as at the time as a step away from sole control of the online token from Ripple the company. Because of its track record of delivering on its goal of decentralizing XRP, including adding 55 more validators to the network last year, Ripple developers believe there's at least some reason to believe it will fulfill its vision, however ambitious. Nomenclature aside, there's still Ripple's relationship to the XRP Ledger to parse. Indeed, a recent Bloomberg report noted that because XRP isn't clearly defined, it could end up being considered a security by the SEC. The assertion seems to stem from attempts by Ripple to have XRP listed on major exchanges, attempts the news source alleges may have failed over this concern. ""While the coin doesn't represent an ownership stake in Ripple, the concern is the close relationship might still lead regulators to deem XRP a security,"" the report reads. In response, the issue has seen no shortage of airtime on social media. The argument against Ripple: Critics here argue that there's a case that XRP could be considered a security because of the way that it was released in many ways a variation on the initial coin offering (ICO) model. Indeed, after XRP Ledger (then called the Ripple Consensus Ledger) was created, XRP tokens were distributed to users of popular bitcoin forums in what isn't all that different from what's today called an ""airdrop."" But while speculative, the comments hint at another issue, the seeming preference among Ripple executives for talking up XRP when the price is going up. Critics argue that when the token sees boosted attention, like over the last several months, Ripple's leaders parade it around. In a recent Fox News interview, for example, CEO Brad Garlinghouse trumpeted XRP specifically as the beginning of a ""new asset class"" solving a ""global payments problem."" Meanwhile, when it's trading sideways, the public-facing company doesn't pay it much attention, critics argue, adding that if Ripple really believes XRP is a crucial piece of its product, the startup should herald it consistently (and within the boundaries of securities laws). The argument for Ripple: Still, others see the security question as moot. For one, Ripple's business doesn't directly influence the value of its cryptocurrency, though it would doubtless benefit from the kind of demand generated by large banking institutions using it to move transactions. In this way, supporters argue there's always been a clear purpose for XRP: it makes any financial products built on the platform even faster and cheaper. Plus, it's not exactly fair to say that the entire company has flip-flopped on their view of XRP. Many of Ripple's chief developers and researchers have held on strong to the idea of XRP as a token, even if the public-facing company appears less steadfast. Ripple has always touted itself as a partner for banks and other large financial services providers, but many critics think the company doesn't give those providers any real compelling reason to use XRP. That said, a spate of companies have begun using all three of Ripple's products - xCurrent, xRapid and xVia - this year. Even a number of financial institutions and payments providers have started piloting the use of xRapid, Ripple's only product that hinges on XRP use. The argument against Ripple: Critics argue that XRP will never get much adoption from big entities. (Even some Ripple clients have said they think XRP is too volatile and risky a currency to adopt right now.) Pseudonymous cryptocurrency investor and essayist P4man argues that the two ideas Ripple tries to mix together only make sense independently. RipplePay, an idea predating cryptocurrency that allows local communities to have more control over their currencies, makes sense as an innovative way to send money through a network of people that users trust. And bitcoin makes sense as a new type of digital currency without control. But mashing them together, as Ripple does, just doesn't work, he contends. Rather it results in an overcomplex system that doesn't result in what it's supposed to: cheaper, faster payments. And P4man goes on to make an even bolder claim: The only ""rational reason"" for XRP to exist is for Ripple to make money off of it amid the cryptocurrency craze, a claim he and other critics believe is backed up by the fact the company and associated foundations own at least 60 billion of the 100 billion total XRP coins. The argument for Ripple: Ripple and its supporters, though, do think there's a reason - they often describe Ripple's ledger products as a trojan horse. Once they successfully carry the Ripple horse to enough banks around the world, they will unleash XRP on the unsuspecting financial system. This is already happening as Ripple begins to encourage companies using xCurrent to move to xRapid for added liquidity. Ripple chief cryptographer David Schwartz expanded on this view in an XRP chat post, arguing that as the startup expands the number of ""corridors"" it operates in, XRP's usefulness increases. ""Now, say you're a company like Seagate that pays out money all over the globe. If you have to make payments to five countries in our corridors, you'd rather hold one pile of XRP than five piles of different currencies,"" he said in a post on the forum, XRP chat. While admitting it's ""a pretty crazy thing"" Ripple is trying to do, Schwartz continued: ""If that succeeds, it should massively increase the price of XRP."" Ripple image via Shutterstock
