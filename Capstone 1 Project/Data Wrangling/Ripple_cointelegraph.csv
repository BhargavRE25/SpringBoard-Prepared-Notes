2018-01-02 03:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,South Korea More Than Doubled Ripple’s Price in Single Week,"Cointelegraph The South Korean cryptocurrency market has played a crucial role in bringing RIpple from a market cap of $40 billion to $88 billion. Analysis The South Korean cryptocurrency market accounts for a relatively small percentage of global Bitcoin trades, but has nonetheless played a crucial role in bringing RIpple’s market capitalization from $40 billion to $88 billion. Ripple was one of the best-performing crypto assets of 2017, boasting a 360x increase in value. Exactly one year ago, on January 1, 2017, a single Ripple sold just six-tenths of a cent. Today, a single token is worth $2.29. Over the past week, Ripple overtook Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency in the global market, becoming the first “altcoin” to reach a $100 billion market valuation. Many investors, especially Ethereum and Bitcoin holders, were taken aback by Ripple’s sudden surge. Analysts have attributed the recent increase in the value of Ripple to the formation of strategic partnerships between SBI Ripple Asia and South Korean banks, according to Forbes. However, the newly partnered banks will only begin processing payments on the Ripple network by the end of the first quarter of 2018. This has led some to question whether these partnerships are the real reason for Ripple’s incredible surge. One such skeptic is Ryan Selkis, entrepreneur-in-residence at Ethereum-focused Blockchain production studio ConsenSys said in an interview: ""I know of no banks that are a) using it, or b) would touch it in any way as it is controlled by a SV company and 20% of all XRP in existence were taken by the founders. The product that Ripple are offering to banks is simply a point-to-point messaging tool with some smart cryptography underneath to ensure that transactions are atomic. The liquidity model used is the same as correspondent banking. Some banks will have deep pools of liquidity available to terminate payments. Ripple's approach with XRP has been to get it listed on a bunch of exchanges and ‘infer' but never explicitly say that banks are using it for settlement.” The claim that no banks are using the Ripple network to process payments is not entirely accurate. Earlier this year, major Swedish bank SEB settled $180 million on the Ripple Blockchain network by sending cross-border payments on behalf of high profile clients. Banks in Thailand and Japan have also been processing near-instantaneous transactions for many months using Ripple. However, it is true that no major banks are utilizing the Ripple Blockchain network on a daily basis to process large volumes of transactions. Tony Lyu, the founder and CEO of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit, told the New York Times that the South Korean market is heavily driven by FOMO, or fear of missing out. Lyu said: “Word just spreads really fast in Korea. Once people are invested, they want everyone else to join the party. There’s been this huge, almost a community movement around this.” Over the past week, the South Korean market and its largest cryptocurrency exchanges including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit have accounted for more than half of Ripple’s $4.5 bln daily trading volume. South Koreans continue to pay a premium for their digital currency. On Bithumb, for instance, Ripple is being traded at $2.54, nearly 24 percent higher than the global average price.  Caption: Price of Ripple and other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb Speculation and cryptocurrency mania in the South Korean market have become a major concern for the government policy makers. South Korean financial authorities have prohibited foreigners and underaged investors from investing in cryptocurrencies in an effort to bring the speculation under control.

2018-01-02 19:00:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan.2","Cointelegraph Bullish market? Let’s see. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The cryptocurrency mania can be gauged from the fact that Bitcoin, with its 1300 percent plus gains, doesn’t find a place among the top 10 best performing cryptocurrencies of 2017. The top performer was Ripple, with more than astounding 30,000 percent increase over a year. In comparison, the traditional investors consider themselves lucky if they outperform the S&P 500, which rallied 20 percent last year. While no one can predict what will happen in 2018, one thing is certain; if the traders can spot the setups, they can reap a rich reward. As we already saw both cryptocurrencies rallying collectively and them going separate ways, it might be a good idea to diversify your portfolio with more than one cryptocurrency. Our attempt should be to trade the best setups that can offer us the maximum profits with the minimum risk. So, let’s find out the probable candidates to buy this week. Bitcoin is finding strong buying support at the 50-day SMA; but, unlike before, it is not able to pullback with strength. The bears are strongly defending the $14,000 levels. The daily range has been shrinking for the past two days.  On Dec. 30, though the BTC/USD pair broke below the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern, it could not break below the 50-day SMA. It quickly climbed back above the neckline on the next day. The bulls are finding it difficult to break out of the overhead resistance from the down trendline and the 20-day EMA; and we don’t find any buy setup between $12,000 and $14,000. Still, Bitcoin is likely to rally to $16,000, once the cryptocurrency breaks out of the down trendline. On the other hand, if it breaks down of $12,000, it can retest the lows made on Dec. 22. We expect a large range move within the next couple of days. We had mentioned that the digital currency will gain strength once it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line and that is what happened.  The ETH/USD pair broke out of the downtrend line on December 31 and crossed the overhead resistance of $760 on January 01. Thereafter, it picked up momentum and has created a new lifetime high today. If the bulls manage to sustain above $863, we can expect a rally to $973 levels, which is the next Fibonacci extension target. The resistance line of the ascending channel is also at this level. Therefore, we expect this level to offer a strong resistance. On the downside, if the bulls fail to sustain above $863, the trendline of the channel close to the $760 mark, will act as a strong support. We expected Bitcoin Cash to plunge to the 50-day SMA, once it broke below the $2,300 mark. Instead, it took support at the trendline and is attempting a recovery.     If the BCH/USD pair sustains above $2,475, it should attempt a rally to $2,900 levels, which is a major resistance. Any fall is likely to be supported at the trendline and if it breaks, the next support is at $2,072. However, the risk to reward ratio is not attractive, hence, we don’t recommend any trade on it right now.     The correction in Ripple was short lived as the buyers jumped in at the $1.61 mark; it shows strength.  For the past two days, the XRP/USD pair had been facing resistance at the $2.1 mark. Today, the bulls broke out of the resistance, which can push the pair to $2.474 levels. We already saw the cryptocurrency consolidating for six to seven days, before resuming its uptrend. Thus, we anticipate a few more days of consolidation before the price breaks out to new lifetime highs. On the downside, $1.8 and $1.6 are the two critical support levels. The momentum loses strength only when it breaks down to $1.6.   We had indicated in our previous analysis that long positions can be initiated on a breakout and close above the downtrend line.  As the bears were unable to sustain below the critical support level of $3.032 for the past few days, chances are that the bulls will attempt to push the price towards the upper end of the range at $5.59. Therefore, traders who haven’t initiated a long position yet can still do at the current levels of $4.121, with a stop loss of $2.85. We are aiming to trade the large range by buying close to the support and selling at the resistance. We await  IOTA/USD pair to be volatile but with a positive bias.    The bears had the upper hand on Dec. 30, with a break of the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. But the bulls supported Litecoin around the $200 mark.  Currently, the LTC/USD pair has broken out of the downtrend line, the neckline and the 20-day EMA. This is a positive move. Above $250, a move to $283 and thereafter to $300 is likely. On the downside, strong support exists at $200 and below this at $175, from the 50-day SMA. As this is still a pullback, we don’t suggest a trade on it. We expected the trendline support to hold and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency fell to the trendline on Dec. 30. However, the bounce from the support has been impressive.    We believe that the DASH/USD pair can now rally to $1,220 levels, where it is likely to face some resistance. On the other hand, any fall will find support at the trendline. Since the risk to reward ratio does not look good, we are not suggesting any trade. Cardano remained in a range from Oct. 01 to Nov. 25. Thereafter, it rallied for four days and again became range-bound until Dec. 14. It then spiked again in the next five days from $0.135375 to $0.581983. Subsequently, it entered into a correction, which ended around the $0.37 levels.    The latest leg of the up move started on Dec. 28 and it has crossed its first target objective of $0.75. The previous rallies lasted for around four to five days. Hence, we anticipate a pullback around the current levels, which should be a good buying opportunity, as the cryptocurrency remains in a strong uptrend. Any pullback should find strong support at $0.68 and $0.60 levels. The market data is provided by TradingView. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2018-01-04 01:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Ripple Pushes Past $3, Reaches Almost Half Bitcoin’s Market Cap","Cointelegraph Ripple crosses $3, growing over 130% in one week, while Bitcoin dominance hits new record low. when moon Ripple (XRP), currently the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has continued its recent rally, crossing the $3 per coin mark. At press time, the altcoin was trading at an average of $3.12. Ripple’s price has increased almost 49,000 percent over the past twelve months. The cryptocurrency passed $2 just last week, seeing a 130% increase since Dec 27. This has cemented Ripple’s number two position with a market cap of $121 bln, almost half that of Bitcoin.  Ripple markets itself as a Blockchain-based payment solution for enterprise level global payment transactions. The addition of the coin on Bloomberg's price terminal in mid-December arguably started the substantial rally. A recent “cryptocurrency mania” on South Korean market, during which almost half of Ripple trading volumes occurred several multiple exchanges in the country, has also contributed to the altcoin’s rise. Investors and cryptocurrency believers have been pursuing other altcoins recently as well, creating substantial gains in the top 30. The most notable gains include Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (XLM), which have both jumped more than 30% on the day, as well as Status (SNT), which saw an over 100 percent increase in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, on Jan. 3 BTC dominance (percentage of total market capitalization) hit a new record low of 34.6 percent. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2018-01-04 18:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 04","Cointelegraph With Bitcoin losing its market value to altcoins, let’s see what orders to place. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. While China banned initial coin offering (ICO) back in September 2017, it has not prevented the Chinese social network Renren from seeking an ICO. The company’s stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange climbed 47.39 percent to $18.32 a share following the news. Similarly, Israeli trading company Plus500 saw its stock price spike 20 percent as it reported that cryptocurrency trading had boosted its profits. This shows that the markets are excited about the companies getting involved with the Blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies. But not regulators, apparently. The Israel Securities Authority, for example, is not in favor of stocks, whose main business is linked to cryptocurrencies. The regulator plans to prohibit the listing of shares of such companies. Will other stock markets regulators also follow? Difficult to say. As the cryptocurrencies market cap has crossed over the $760 bln point with altcoins outperforming Bitcoin, let’s see if we can identify any buy or sell patterns today. Though Bitcoin broke out of the downtrend line, it did not reach our expected target objective of $16,000. Failure of the bulls to capitalize on the breakout of the downtrend line is a bearish sign.  We find a symmetrical triangle developing, which is a continuation pattern. The cryptocurrency is currently retesting the breakout levels of the triangle. If it holds the $14,000 levels and reverses direction, we suggest long positions above $15,500. If the BTC/USD pair falls below $14,000, it is likely to fall to the neckline and below that to the trendline of the triangle. A breakdown of $12,000 levels will be negative, which can extend the fall to $8,000 levels. Therefore, traders should keep a stop loss around $13,500 once their long positions are triggered. Also, avoid buying below the specified levels. We expected a move to $973, once Ethereum sustained above $863 and it has reached our target objective today.    The resistance line of the channel is likely to act as strong resistance. Based on the previous experience, we find that once the cryptocurrencies are in a momentum, they overshoot their target objectives. Therefore, traders can book partial profits at the resistance line and hold the rest with a close stop-loss because if the ETH/USD pair breaks out of the ascending channel, it can rally to $1,200 levels. However, the markets can turn down in a jiffy, so make sure to trail the stops higher instead of being fixated on the targets. Though Bitcoin Cash broke out of $2,475, it could not reach $2,900 levels, as we had expected. It turned back from $2,770.6933.      The cryptocurrency has again fallen to the critical trendline support, which has provided support on two previous occasions. If this level breaks, there is marginal support at the $2,072.6853 point; below that a fall to $1,733.3558 is likely. If the trendline support holds, we may see another attempt by the bulls to push the  BCH/USD pair higher. The pair is likely to gain momentum above $2,800 levels.     Ripple did not waste any time in consolidation, as we had anticipated. It just broke out to new lifetime highs yesterday and has continued higher.  With this rally, the pair has risen from a low of $0.22255 on December 11 to a high of $3.317 today. That is a 1,390 percent rally within a month. It is difficult to project a target when an asset class is backed by such a strong momentum. However, as a reference, the next target on the XRP/USD pair is $3.414 and above it $3.90469. Nevertheless, even at the risk of missing out on a further rally, we believe that the traders should book about 50% profits at the current levels and hold the rest with a close stop loss. The cryptocurrency is clearly overbought and is due for a correction or a consolidation shortly.    We have recommended long positions on IOTA in our two previous analyses. We expect the bulls to attempt a rally towards the upper end of the range at $5.59.  The bears are defending the overhead resistance of $4.34. Currently, the IOTA/USD pair is taking support at the 20-day EMA. If this level breaks, it is likely to retest the lows at $3.03 levels. The cryptocurrency pair will gain momentum only above $4.34 levels. Since IOTA is still inside the range, we recommend holding to the long position with a stop loss of $2.85. We shall reconsider our position in a couple of days.    The pullback in Litecoin could not sustain above the $250 levels. The cryptocurrency has again broken below the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern.  It has again broken below the 20-day EMA, which has flattened out. Still, we find buying on dips, closer to the $200 levels. The LTC/USD pair has support at $195.417, below that at $179.7308 from the 50-day SMA, and finally at $175.199, which is the lows formed on December 22. If the cryptocurrency pair doesn’t break out of $260 within a couple of days, we expect it to resume its slide towards the lower targets. NEM has climbed from a low of $0.23595 on December 08 to a high of $2.06278 today, which is a 774 percent rally within a month. It has climbed to the sixth position in terms of market capitalization. Hence, we included it in our analysis.    The XEM/USD pair has risen vertically over the past three days. It has a target objective of $2.13774, which is a critical Fibonacci extension level. We expect some resistance at this overhead resistance. Therefore, traders should keep a close stop-loss on their position. It does not necessarily mean that the cryptocurrency will crash from $2.13774 levels. It can consolidate for a few days and then again resume its uptrend. In a correction, we expect support at $1.57849 and $1.42889, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent leg of the up move from $0.794 to $2.06278.   As we don’t have the charts with enough data available for ADA/USD, we are analyzing the ADA/BTC pair. We expected Cardano to correct in our previous analysis; however, it extended its rally in the past two days and proved us wrong.  From a low of 0.00000338 on Nov. 25 to a high of 0.00009180, today, the ADA/BTC pair has risen 2,615 percent in one and half months. This shows that it is in a strong momentum. Though momentum can carry it higher, the rally is overextended and is likely to enter into a consolidation or correction soon. Therefore, traders should book partial profits on every rise and should keep a close stop loss on their remaining position. It is difficult to call a top, but the risk to reward is skewed to the downside. The market data is provided by TradingView.

2018-01-05 03:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Coinbase Rejects Ripple Integration Rumors, Currency’s Market Cap Drops $22 Billion","Cointelegraph Coinbase has refuted recent rumors that Ripple (XRP) will be integrated into GDAX, its flagship digital currency exchange. Analysis The popular exchange and wallet platform Coinbase has refuted recent rumors that Ripple (XRP) or other cryptocurrencies will soon be integrated into GDAX, its flagship digital currency exchange. CEO Brian Armstrong firmly stated that neither Coinbase and GDAX have made a decision to integrate any cryptocurrency or digital asset in the short-term. The company said in a blog post: “A committee of internal experts is responsible for determining whether and when new assets will be added to the platform in accordance with our framework. These individuals — and all employees at Coinbase — are subject to confidentiality and trading restrictions. As of the date of this statement, we have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company.” Coinbase’s statement was released following a spate of unverified rumors that claimed GDAX is planning to integrate XRP. The scale of the rumors, which largely circulated on Reddit and Twitter, increased to the point where the company felt the need to refute them, as the price of XRP surged. Immediately after Coinbase issued its statement, the market valuation of XRP decreased from over $148 billion to $126 billion.  Coinbase and GDAX are unlikely to integrate any new assets until they can be certain to prevent any leaks. In early December, when Coinbase added Bitcoin Cash, a Coinbase employee or a contractor reportedly revealed the integration two days prior to the official announcement. Coinbase received significant backlash and criticism from the cryptocurrency community and as a consequence, Armstrong vowed to launch a full investigation. The CEO stated that Coinbase will pursue legal action against the employee or contractor that released confidential information on the company’s digital asset integration plans. As such, the recent statement of Armstrong and rumors around Coinbase’s Ripple integration were also criticized by some of the community’s most prominent experts. These include BitGo lead engineer Jameson Lopp, who tweeted: We haven't made any decisions to add new assets to Coinbase or GDAX at this time. Any statement to the contrary is untrue. Be careful what you believe out there! https://t.co/1yUYG33AoG The investigation into the Bitcoin Cash controversy is still ongoing and until that is completed, it is highly unlikely that Coinbase will pursue the implementation of other cryptocurrencies. The company’s CEO admitted that some insider trading-like movement was spotted in the global Bitcoin Cash exchange market prior to the listing of Coinbase. On December 20, Armstrong wrote: “Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter. If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies — directly or indirectly — I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.” Former Coinbase executive Charlie Lee also stated: “Coinbase is not adding a new coin anytime soon. There's no reason why they would lie about this... Especially after the flack they got for surprising everyone by adding BCH.” Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2018-01-05 12:18:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Success Tips Chairman For World’s Richest As Zuckerberg Eyes Crypto,"Cointelegraph Ripple’s chairman and co-founder could be richer than Mark Zuckerberg or even Bill Gates, reports claim. Brief Ripple Chairman and Co-founder Chris Larsen has profited so much from the asset’s bull run he could be the world’s richest person. That’s according to BitFury CEO George Kikvadze, whose made a tweet about Larsen’s likely huge personal wealth gains over the past year. “At Ripple's Implied Market Value of $320 bln - Chris Larsen with his 37 percent stake has become the world's richest person bypassing (Bill Gates) & (Warren Buffett),” Kikvadze noted Wednesday. BREAKING: At RIPPLE'S Implied Market Value of $320Bln - Chris Larsen with his 37% stake has become the world's richest person bypassing @BillGates & @WarrenBuffett !!! @CNBC @business @Forbes CONGRATS CHRIS ! Ripple’s XRP token has delighted investors into 2018 with gains of over 35,000 percent, much of that taking place in the last few months. Shooting up to highs above $3.60 per token, only Coinbase’s announcement that it had “no plans” to add new assets, including XRP, was able to take prices down somewhat. On the topic of Larsen meanwhile, Forbes gave a more conservative outlook, nonetheless placing the co-founder’s wealth at up to $59 bln. “That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people,” the New York Times commented on the data. Zuckerberg had coincidentally hinted at plans to integrate cryptocurrency with unnamed Facebook “services” this week, announcing in a post that he was “interested in going deeper and studying the positive and negative aspects of [technologies like encryption and cryptocurrencies], and how best to use them.” Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2018-01-06 18:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan. 06: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano","Cointelegraph With the market capitalization getting close to $1 tln point, what orders shall we place? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Most traditional investors have stayed away from Bitcoin citing its volatility. Yet, this has not stopped Direxion Asset Management LLC from planning to list “leveraged” and “inverse” funds that will rise or fall twice as fast as the Bitcoin price. Nevertheless, the big question is whether the US securities regulators will give the nod to such an instrument. Any ETF acceptance is likely to give a big boost to cryptocurrencies. With the market capitalization of the crypto universe inching towards the $1 tln mark, let’s see what kind of trading moves might seem suitable. We had suggested initiating long positions in Bitcoin at $15,500 in our previous analysis. The level was reached yesterday, Jan. 5, which triggered the long position. Subsequently, the price broke out of the resistance at $16,500 and rallied to a high of $17,083.67, where it witnessed profit booking.  Currently, the cryptocurrency is in a pullback. It is likely to find support at the $15,500 mark that had served as resistance earlier. The trendline support is also at the same level. The BTC/USD pair is still not out of the woods. If it returns from the current levels and breaks the neckline at $13,000, it will complete a complex head and shoulders pattern, which will be a bearish sign. Therefore, we recommend keeping a stop loss of $15,000 in our positions. It’ll reduce our risk.   On the upside, we expect a rally to $19,000 levels if Bitcoin sustains above $17,000. But traders should trail their stops higher as the trade moves in their favor. For the past two days, Jan.4-5, Ethereum has been facing profit booking at the resistance line of the ascending channel.     It has not given up any ground, which shows buying strength at lower levels. We anticipate another attempt by the bulls to break out of the channel. If successful, the ETH/USD pair can climb to $1,200 levels and thereafter to $1,310. In case the bulls fail to break out of the ascending channel, a fall to the lower end of the channel at $840 is likely. That’s why we believe partial profits should be taken between $1,000 and $1,040 levels. Rest of the positions can be held with a close stop loss depending on the strategy of the trader. Though Bitcoin Cash broke below the trendline, it held on to the $2,291 levels that has provided support for four days in a row.  For the past two days, the cryptocurrency has been trading in a tight range of $2,991 - $2,553.18. If the bulls break out and sustain above $2,555, a move to $2,800 and thereafter to $2,900 is likely. But if the support breaks, the BCH/USD pair is likely to extend its fall to $2,072.6853. We don’t have a clear buy set up, so we are not recommending any trade.     Ripple is currently in a pullback after reaching a high of $3.317 on Jan. 04. However, the fall to $2.15 levels yesterday, Jan.5, was bought aggressively. In the near term, this is a critical support point, below which the correction is likely to extend to $1.76 levels.  In order to understand whether the traders should expect a further rally or a correction, we have gone back to the start of the year using a log scale. Ripple has a history of sharp rallies, which are followed by a period of correction/consolidation. The first up move from March 2 to April 2 of this year saw about 1,100 percent rise. The second rally from April 25 to May 17 resulted in 1,183 percent gain. The most recent rally from Dec. 11 to Jan. 4 led to 1,390 percent growth. We find that the duration of the up move and the quantum of the rally is almost similar in all the three instances. So there might be a chance the XRP/USD pair has just formed a short-term top. Both the previous corrections found support at about 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. If history repeats itself, we are likely to see a fall to $1.40 levels. However, this is not an exact science and the above-mentioned projections will be invalidated if Ripple breaks out and sustains above $3.317.      IOTA has been trading inside the $3.032 - $5.59 range since Dec. 06. Traders who follow us would have taken long positions at $3.904. For people who missed buying at those levels, we had suggested a buy at $4.121.  As the bears failed to break down of the range, we expect the bulls to attempt to rally to the upper end of the range. Currently, the IOTA/USD pair is taking support at the 20-day EMA but is facing resistance at $4.34 levels. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the overhead resistance, a rally to $5.59 is likely. However, if the bears push the cryptocurrency below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to $3.03 levels. We suggest holding the long positions with a stop-loss of $2.85.     The bears could not capitalize on the neckline breakdown of the head and shoulders pattern on two occasions.  As a result, the bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend. But we expect profit booking at higher levels as the LTC/USD pair climbs to the lifetime highs. The cryptocurrency will become negative only on a breakdown below $175. We expect Litecoin to trade in a range for the next few days. Currently, we don’t find any reliable setups, hence, we are not anticipating any trade on it. We expected NEM to face resistance at $2.13774 levels and it returned from $2.06278. The cryptocurrency corrected close to $1.42889, which is 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally from $0.795 to $2.06278.  If the $1.4 level holds, we expect the bulls to attempt to resume the uptrend once again. Therefore, aggressive traders can buy at $1.702 and keep a stop loss of $1.4. Our target objective is a retest of the highs. However, this is a risky trade and should be attempted only with about 25 percent of the usual allocation. Risk-averse traders should wait for a set up with a better risk to reward ratio because if $1.4 level breaks, the XEM/USD pair is likely to fall to the trendline support.   We had recommended traders to book profits and trade with a close stop loss. The ADA/BTC pair topped out on Jan. 4 at 0.00009180.  The pullback is finding support at the 0.000053 levels, which is just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 0.00002539 to 0.00009180. If the levels hold, we may see an attempt by the bulls to resume the uptrend. However, we expect to see profit booking at higher levels. We await a range bound move in ADA/BTC for the next few days.

2018-01-08 12:34:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,“I’ve Bought All That Ripple!” CNBC Airs Bizarre Live Tutorial On Buying XRP,"Cointelegraph Brian Kelly has shown CNBC viewers just how to buy Ripple in Poloniex in a strange edition of the network’s Fast Money segment. Brief US mainstream media network CNBC has caused a stir after airing a step-by-step tutorial on how to buy Ripple on Poloniex. In what would previously have been an unlikely format for the broadcaster, host Brian Kelly used screens of the Poloniex order book to guide consumers through the process of specifically acquiring Ripple’s XRP token. He then performed a live spot trade in which he converted around three BTC to XRP. “I’ve bought all that Ripple - that’s how easy and fast it is,” Kelly commented. Lol @CNBC is showing people how to use the internet to buy Ripple. Literally click-by-click tutorial followed by “that’s how easy it is!”This is so insane. pic.twitter.com/8uzt0YP5Po While the edition of CNBC’s Fast Money segment is conspicuous for its arguably promotional rather than informative nature, it is not the first time the network has chosen to overtly ‘plug’ a certain cryptocurrency. In December, the sudden appearance of pro-Bitcoin Cash content both on air and on social media accounts raised significant suspicions from the cryptocurrency community. XRP’s astronomical price rise has meanwhile likewise given rise to concerns from those unconvinced by the utility of the token versus the platform itself. Ripple businesses are not required to invest in XRP. Nonetheless, CEO Brad Garlinghouse remains adamant its use as a currency will deal a blow to Bitcoin, a perspective mainstream publications other than CNBC have since jumped on. “A lot for the speculation that’s gone on about XRP lately is people realizing Bitcoin is not going to be the kind of panacea of all things Blockchain we once thought it would be,” Garlinghouse told NBC. “Instead you’re having vertical specific. XRP is solving a payments problem and it’s very efficient to do that.” Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2018-01-08 18:05:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Cryptocurrency Market Takes a Tumble as Ripple Bubble Fear Looms,"Cointelegraph The top 16 cryptocurrencies have all plunged between three and 39 percent today as altcoin bubble fears loom and Bitcoin feels the pinch. Analysis 2018 did not begin on a good note for Bitcoin as the monster rally leading to Christmas crashed, but it made a bit of a recovery in and among a boom for a number of altcoins. However, Monday has not been a good day for the entire cryptocurrency market. Looking down the graphs of the top cryptocurrencies, you’d be hard-pressed to find one in the black as all of the top 10 coins hit a downward trend, led by Ripple which had dropped by almost 28 percent over the last 24 hours. Coinmarketcap showed some unpleasant numbers for all top 10 coins as Bitcoin was registered as being down 11 percent, Ripple down 28 percent and Bitcoin Cash down 20 percent.  Ripple’s losses were by and far the biggest, especially considering the growth the coin experienced in the past few weeks. Ripple reached $3 a coin a few days ago after it was added to Bloomberg’s price terminal in late December. South Korea also recently pushed up the altcoin market as the mania strike the Asian country with Ripple’s doubling up attributed to South Korea being taken with the Blockchain-based payment solution for enterprise-level global payment transactions. The low Ripple numbers may be down to the fact that Coinmarketcap does not including information from some South Korean exchanges, but there are other concerns afoot. ""The reason ripple is surging so much is it's a bubble,"" said Erik Voorhees, CEO of digital asset exchange ShapeShift and a vocal advocate for Bitcoin as a way to separate money and the state. ""Testing crypto with banks doesn't make sense. The whole idea of crypto is you don't need a bank.” The technology behind Ripple is aimed at large institutions, which has given it an air of legitimacy which in turn has spurred the price and build a hype for investors. However, cryptocurrency enthusiasts say that centralization is the exact opposite of what the technology of the digital currencies should be about. Many saw the recent dip in Bitcoin’s dominance as the reemergence of altcoins, with Ripple, and even other minor coins like Verge stealing the limelight. However, this recent dip seems to suggest that there are still strong ties between many coins to the dominant force that is Bitcoin. The adage goes that: 'A rising tide lifts all boats,' and the same goes for a falling one. With Bitcoin still being the biggest boat in the bay, it makes sense that should an issue affect it and its price, other coins in the crypto market will also feel the effect. Famed stock picker Ronnie Moas recently predicted that there would be a reverse on this so-called ‘altcoin season,’ and perhaps, this is it as everyone goes down before the most established digital currency again rises up.

2018-01-08 20:50:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 8","Cointelegraph Latest price review and trading suggestions. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. After a bumper 2017, the cryptocurrency market is attracting new traders who wish to make a fortune in short time. While this is a bullish development, it is also fraught with risk. Most newbies entering the markets believe that it is a ‘get rich quick’ scheme. However, a majority will end up investing in coins that are likely to vanish from the scene in a few years. Too many inexperienced traders willing to buy at any price can lead to a bubble, which will end with a sharp downturn that does not bounce back quickly. Hope, we are smart enough to identify the bear market beforehand and emerge with minimum losses. Traders should always keep an eye on the risk so that they can last in this business for the long-term.   Bitcoin could not sustain above $17,000 levels, which encouraged profit booking and selling at the higher levels. It has broken below the 20-day EMA and the trendline support, hitting our trailing stop loss at $15,000. If the bears can sustain below $15,000, the cryptocurrency will become negative and extend its fall to $14,000. Below this level, the 50-day SMA is the last major support, which has not been broken convincingly since end-September. Therefore, if the bears succeed in sustaining below the 50-day SMA, it will indicate weakness. The head and shoulders pattern is still intact and if the price breaks below the neckline, traders should brace themselves for lower levels, even below $10,000. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair takes support and turns around from any of the above-mentioned support levels and breaks out of $17,200 levels. Ethereum broke out of the ascending channel yesterday, Jan. 7, and rose to $1,191 levels, where it witnessed profit booking. We had mentioned $1,200 as one of the possible targets in our previous analysis. If bulls manage to break out of $1,200, the next target on the upside is $1,310, which is arrived at by adding the width of the channel to the breakout point of the channel.   However, currently, the price has turned down and has entered into the channel once again, which is a negative sign. Levels that can offer support are $993.91 and $933.03, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent retracement levels of the latest leg of the rally. If the bulls fail to propel the ETH/USD pair back above the channel quickly, we most likely see a fall to $820, which is the trendline support of the channel increase. Bitcoin Cash could not break out of the $2,800 levels yesterday, Jan. 7. As a result, it has now formed a range between $2,291 and $2,770.6933. The lower end of the range has held on four occasions. If it holds again, we are likely to witness a few more days of range-bound trading. But if the range breaks down, it is likely to attract further selling, which can sink the BCH/USD pair to the 50-day SMA, close to $2,000.     For the past three days, Ripple has been trading inside the large range formed on Jan. 5. The support on the downside is between $2.13492, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, and $2.15777, the low on Jan. 5. On the upside, resistance lies at $2.849, $3.06 and $3.317. As mentioned earlier, we expect the XRP/USD pair to fall to about $1.4 levels eventually and remain range bound for the next few days. It’ll prove to be wrong if the price breaks out to new lifetime highs.      On Jan. 7, IOTA again failed to sustain above the overhead resistance at $4.34. We hold long positions initiated at $3.904 and $4.121. As the bulls have failed to sustain above $4.34 on three occasions, we believe that the bears are likely to push the cryptocurrency down to the lower end of the range. Our current suggested stop loss is at $2.85. Although considering the weakness in Bitcoin and most other top currencies, we recommend raising our stop loss to $3.5. We shall initiate long positions again when the IOTA/USD pair falls to the bottom of the range at $3.032.     The attempts by the bulls to resume the uptrend in Litecoin hit a wall on Jan. 6, at $307.992. After the stellar rally from $84.708 to $370, the cryptocurrency has entered a period of correction/consolidation and has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern.   A breakout from the triangle and the overhead resistance at $307.992 is likely to resume the uptrend in the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, a breakdown from the triangle will be bearish, which can result in a sharp fall if the price breaks below $175.199. As long as the LTC/USD pair trades inside the triangle, it is likely to remain volatile and trendless. We had recommended a long position at $1.072 expecting a retest of the highs. Yet, NEM could only reach a high of $1.9. Like all other cryptocurrencies, the XEM/USD pair has also turned down sharply. It is likely to break below our stop loss of $1.4 and fall towards the trendline. If the trendline support breaks, a fall to $0.795 is likely.    On the upside, the bulls will face a stiff resistance between $1.9 and the lifetime highs. After the large range day on Jan. 5, Cardano remained in a small range on Jan. 6 and Jan.7. Today, the cryptocurrency has turned down. Its immediate support is at 0.00005347, which is the low reached Jan. 5. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to the 20-day EMA. However, if the ADA/BTC pair holds the support levels, we may see another attempt to resume the uptrend. Any long positions should only be initiated once the price breaks out of 0.00006655.

2018-01-09 19:37:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"CoinMarketCap Removes South Korea Exchanges, Ripple Market Cap Drops $20 Billion","Cointelegraph Major South Korean exchanges were excluded from CoinMarketCap’s price calculations, Ripple prices drop almost 30% in a day Brief Highly popular cryptocurrency price tracker CoinMarketCap removed several South Korean exchanges from its listings on Jan. 8, causing a dip in the overall market that particularly affected altcoin Ripple (XRP). The exchanges removed include Bithumb, the world’s second largest exchange in terms of trading volume, along with Coinone and Korbit. CoinMarketCap, which uses data from multiple major global exchanges to produce averaged prices for cryptocurrencies, tweeted Monday about their decision to remove the exchanges, saying that it was due to “the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity.” This morning we excluded some Korean exchanges in price calculations due to the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity. We are working on better tools to provide users with the averages that are most relevant to them. CoinMarketCap’s decision was followed by a dramatic reverse in Ripple’s record-breaking uptrend. The day CoinMarketCap removed the South Korean exchanges, Ripple saw an immediate loss of over $20 bln in market capitalization, and an almost 30 percent price drop Jan. 8. The altcoin was overtaken by Ethereum (ETH) as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Ripple in particular is traded on South Korean exchanges at very high volumes, a fact which reportedly helped bring Ripple to second place on the crypto market just last week. Prices on South Korean exchanges are also over a dollar higher than on most other exchanges globally, which is part of what prompted CoinMarketCap to exclude them.  Rumors that Coinbase would add the altcoin, followed by confirmation on Jan. 4 that it would not, caused a peak and drop in Ripple’s price in the first few days of January. However the price drop after CoinMarketCap’s Jan. 8 decision had a more immediate and drastic effect, with an over 16 percent drop in the space of 6 minutes.  As a result of the move, XRP is currently trailing by some $0.60 on CoinMarketCap versus similar services such as Live Coin Watch, which still includes the major Korean exchanges. Users on Twitter complained that CoinMarketCap’s failure to promptly alert users about their decision caused panic selling that in turn aggravated the market drop. Coinmarketcap's decision to exclude Korean prices from the displayed XRP price made the price appear to drop, likely triggering some panic selling. Look closely at the data and don't be mislead. On Jan. 7 local media in South Korea reported that authorities will inspect six of the country’s major banks to probe for money laundering via cryptocurrency.

2018-01-11 00:35:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan.10: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano","Cointelegraph With Blockchain becoming a buzzword for the traditional finances, will the market boom again? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. On Jan 9, the photography giant Kodak announced a launch of its cryptocurrency KodakCoin scheduled by the end of the month. This news led to a spike in Kodak stock prices. Yet it’s unpredictable whether it will boost the company’s capitalization, but at least the company has been quick in adopting the technology of the future. The jump in Kodak’s stock prices points to the crypto craze infecting even traditional investors. In the past few days, they have lapped up stocks of the companies that have connected with Blockchain or cryptocurrency. Even JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in a recent exclusive interview to Fox Business, stated that he regrets calling Bitcoin a fraud.   As traders, our interest is to buy the cryptocurrencies that will offer us maximum profits. Let’s see if we can find out any buy setups. On Jan. 8, though the bulls purchased the fall to the 50-day SMA, they could not capitalize on the gains. Recovery attempts faced resistance at the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. As a result, Bitcoin has again fallen to the 50-day SMA. Bitcoin is currently trading at critical support levels, where it has support from the 50-day SMA, the trendline support of the symmetrical triangle and the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. If this support holds, the cryptocurrency is likely to continue to trade inside the symmetrical triangle. But if the price breaks down of this critical support zone, a fall to $8,000 is likely, with minor support at $10,705 levels. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair turns up and breaks above the $17,200 level. But we think there are small chances of that happening. Ethereum has broken above $1,310 levels, which was the target objective as mentioned in our previous analysis.    We believe that the cryptocurrency will find it difficult to break out of the overhead resistance zone between $1,310 and $1,434. Therefore, traders who have entered long positions at lower levels can book partial profits in this resistance zone. We expect the ETH/USD pair to enter a period of correction/consolidation for the next few days. In a drop, the resistance line of the ascending channel will be the first support. If this holds, we can expect a few days of range-bound trading. Still, we can see a fall to the 20-day EMA if the bears succeed in pushing prices back into the channel. Bitcoin Cash continues to trade in the $2,291 - $2,770 range. The attempt to break down failed on Jan. 8. Currently, the cryptocurrency has strong buying support. In case the price breaks out of the upper end of the range, it may move to $3,249. Above this level, a retest of the highs is also possible. However, if the bulls fail to do that and sustain above the range, range bound action is likely to continue for a few more days. Trading will be volatile inside this range. The next trend will start once the BCH/USD pair breaks out or breaks down. On the downside, the $2,000 to $2,291 support zone is important, because if it breaks, a slide to $1,733 and thereafter to $1,200 is likely.     We had predicted a fall to $1.40 levels on Ripple on Jan. 6 and today, Jan. 10, the price touched a low of $1.61, which is close to our projected levels. The bulls are trying to defend the uptrend line and the 20-day EMA. After more than 50 percent correction within a week, we may see an attempt to bounce. However, we believe that any recovery will face stiff resistance between $2.46 and $2.80. If the bulls are unsuccessful in holding the trendline support, a slide to $1.40 is possible, which should hold. We expect a few days of the range bound action in the XRP/USD pair.      In the medium term, IOTA is range bound between $3.03 and $5.59. However, in the short term, the range has shrunk to $3.03-$4.34. The lower end of the range has held for more than a month. Therefore, we believe that the bulls will continue to defend this level and the cryptocurrency will gradually recover to $4.34 and thereafter to $5.59 levels. The IOTA/USD pair might become bearish and slide towards $1.70 if this level breaks. But it is quite unlikely.      Litecoin continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle pattern. Trading is likely to be volatile until the price breaks out or breaks down. If the LTC/USD pair breaks down from the symmetrical triangle, it will become negative and slide to $175. On the upside, the bulls could face stiff resistance in the $280 - $308 zone. We don’t find any trading setups as long as the cryptocurrency trades inside the triangle. Though the bulls bought the lows on Jan. 8, the pullback did not find buyers at higher levels. Today, NEM has extended its decline towards the trendline support. We believe that the support zone between the 20-day EMA and the trendline is likely to increase buying. A bounce from these levels can’t be ruled out. Yet, we don’t expect to see a rally because chances are the XEM/USD pair will face resistance on every rise. We anticipate a range bound trading in NEM for the next few days. As forecast earlier, Cardano has declined to the 20-day EMA. With the fall, it has given up more than 61.8 percent of the gains from the latest leg of the rally from 0.00002539 to 0.00009180. We believe that the zone between the trendline and the 20-day EMA is likely to act as strong support. Hence, a pullback from the support levels can’t be ruled out. Nevertheless, positions should be initiated only on bottom confirmation because if the ADA/BTC pair breaks down of the trendline, it can fall to 0.00002539 levels.

2018-01-11 18:55:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Announces Partnership With MoneyGram To Speed Fiat Settlements,"Cointelegraph Ripple announces that it will partner with to enhance the fiat payment platform’s settlement rates. Brief Blockchain-based payments gateway Ripple announced a new partnership with payment service MoneyGram today, Jan. 11. In a blog post today, Ripple confirmed that MoneyGram would integrate Ripple’s XRP altcoin into its payment system. The integration, according to Ripple, “allows MoneyGram to solve the age-old liquidity issue most financial institutions face.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse commented in company’s blog post announcing the partnership: “The payments problem doesn’t just affect banks; it also affects companies like MoneyGram, which help people get money to the ones they care about. By using a digital asset like XRP that settles in three seconds or less, our clients can move money as quickly as information.” Garlinghouse has increasingly championed XRP’s perceived advantages as a currency over Bitcoin as interest and trade increased. Given Ripple’s market value in early January, the company’s chairman, Chris Larsen, was then reported to have accrued personal wealth to rival Warren Buffett and Bill Gates due to his 37 percent stake. Ripple has unveiled several partnership deals in recent weeks, and in the first week of 2018, the value of XRP skyrocketed to highs barely imaginable just months ago. While the rate of appreciation drew no shortage of warnings and criticism, the refusal of Coinbase to add the altcoin reportedly precipitated a 30 percent downturn last week, something the latest news appears to be changing. XRP is up almost eight percent in the 24 hours to press time according to data from CoinMarketCap, which since Jan. 8 does not include some major South Korean markets.

2018-01-11 21:05:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Hate: Is Ripple a Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing?,"Cointelegraph Ripple exhibits a few traits that many in the cryptocurrency community do not approve of. Analysis Cryptocurrency purists have always judged new coins by a few important factors. On top of that list has always been decentralization. However, one of the bigger coins in the cryptocurrency market has been hiding in plain sight with its centralized nature. But, its recent boom that saw it finish last year as one of top performing crypto assets has seen it garner a lot of hate. Ripple, a token created by the company of the same name that aims to facilitate transfers between major financial corporations. In this goal, it has seen much success over 2017 with a few major banks partnering with it. Despite working with central banks, it is the centralized nature that has many up in arms. When the system was created in 2013, the development team removed many of the key features you find in most other cryptocurrencies. This was done in so that the token could be geared towards these major financial institutions, which is fine and probably necessary, but it becomes problematic when Ripple is counted in the same breath as Bitcoin and other very decentralized digital currencies. Ripple issues its token in a centralized fashion, unlike other coins which are mined and incentivized by people dedicating computing power to accumulate them. Many in the community, including creators of other coins, have slammed Ripple’s definition as a cryptocurrency. “For the most part, I’m not frustrated or angry with Ripple, I’m frustrated with the community’s general lack of knowledge these days (i.e., Ripple is a symptom, but not the problem itself),” Reddit user thieflar, a moderator of the Bitcoin subreddit, tells Inverse. “The fact that Ripple is labeled as a “cryptocurrency” and included on sites like CoinMarketCap has been, for the most part, seen as misleading and inaccurate for many years now,” thieflar adds. Litecoin creator, Charlie Lee, has said that he does not believe that Ripple should even be considered a cryptocurrency. R3 sues Ripple for $1B. Option to buy 5B XRPs?! Circulation supply is only 38B. ?‍♂️ XRP is NOT a crypto-currency.https://t.co/gVx2IIgk5a pic.twitter.com/hBQw1RvgQb Additionally, Cointelegraph writer, Joseph Young has shared similar sentiments. Ripple is locking up $14 billion of its native ""currency"" to control its price?Locking funds itself is bad. The intent is even worse. pic.twitter.com/X9xaqJHDfV Despite the mixed opinions of Ripple, it still made big gains in 2017, going up 36,000 percent. This caused it’s market cap to push the coin up to second on Coinmarketcap for a period. However, even this accolade has been slammed. “It seems like the multiple-year-long cryptocurrency bull-market eventually reached a point where newcomers have been buying indiscriminately, not understanding anything about what they are buying other than ‘it’s a crypto coin so you can make money with it,’ and Ripple managed to get caught up in the madness,” thieflar continues. Interestingly, Ripple itself agrees that it should not be bought indiscriminately to try and make money off the gains. “Private exchanges and liquidity providers may choose to hold additional XRP for trading. Ripple (the company) does not promote XRP as a speculative investment,” it is stated in their gateway guide. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2018-01-12 23:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 12","Cointelegraph Are there signs of waning momentum? Price Analysis The South Korean government has confirmed that it has no plans to ban cryptocurrency trading in the short-term. This is a major relief to the markets, which were reeling under selling pressure. Warren Buffet’s warning that the cryptocurrencies will have a “bad ending” also did not have any noticeable effect on the prices. During the recent decline, instead of being perturbed, many traders saw this as a buying opportunity and rushed to open new accounts. The cryptocurrency exchange Binance saw a whopping addition of 240,000 users in just an hour on Jan. 10. However, unlike the previous occasions, the pullback from the lows has been muted. Is this a sign of waning momentum? Let’s find out. Bitcoin broke below the 50-day SMA on Jan. 11 and since then, it has been struggling to climb above it. It has managed to hold on to the critical support level between the trendline of the symmetrical triangle and the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.  If Bitcoin fails to rally within the next two days, chances are that it will turn down and break below $12,500, sinking it to $8,000 levels. On the other hand, if the cryptocurrency clings on to the support and moves above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate a short-term bottom. Very aggressive traders can buy on a breakout above $14,500 and keep a stop loss of $12,500. The target objective of this trade is $16,500. This is a very risky trade, hence, should be attempted with only 25 percent of the usual position size. Risk-averse traders should wait for a reliable setup to form as there is no clear trend on the BTC/USD pair as long as it trades inside the triangle. It’s better to wait for a breakout or breakdown from the triangle before initiating any positions. Ethereum has been comparatively strong during the South Korean ban episode. This shows that its owners are not in a hurry to sell their holdings.     The buyers jumped in at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the latest rally from $640.43 to $1,382. The uptrend remains intact and the bulls are likely to make another attempt to break out of the recent highs at $1,382. If the price breaks out of the overhead resistance zone of $1,382 to $1,434, it will signal the start of the next leg of the up move, which can carry the ETH/USD pair towards its target objective of $1,814.67. On the downside, support exists at the 20-day EMA and at $965.18, which is the intraday low on Jan. 8. However, as we expect a strong resistance between $1,382 and $1,434, we are not recommending any fresh long positions in it. Bitcoin Cash broke out of the range on Jan. 10, however, contrary to our expectation, it could not rally to $3,249. It faced strong resistance at $2,950 and turned down from there.  It continues to be range bound but in a larger range. On the upside, $2,950 is the critical resistance and on the downside, $2,291 continues to be a strong support. If this support breaks, it has another support at the $2,072 level. Traders should wait for a breakout above $2950 to initiate long positions. The breakout is likely to carry the BCH/USD pair towards the highs. On the other hand, a breakdown below $2,072 can result in a decline to $1,733 and thereafter to $1,200.     For the past three days, Ripple has been attempting to hold the uptrend line. The bulls continue to buy the dips close to the $1.5 levels.  The cryptocurrency is currently correcting inside a descending channel. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the resistance line of the channel, a move to $2.85 is likely. Strong support exists between $1.76978 and $1.40463, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally from $0.22255 to $3.317. But we don’t find any reliable buy setups on the XRP/USD pair. Hence, we are not recommending any trade on it.      IOTA has continued its range-bound trading between $3.032 and $4.34. Yesterday, Jan. 11, the bulls again defended the lower end of the range.  We expect the range to hold.  Hence, traders can buy on weakness towards $3.1 and keep a stop loss of $2.7. The IOTA/USD pair should attempt to move towards $4.34 once it breaks out of the downtrend line. A move above $4.34 is likely to propel it towards the upper end of the range at $5.59. Our bullish view will be invalidated if price breaks down and sustains below $3.032.     Litecoin is still stuck inside the symmetrical triangle. Yesterday, Jan.11,  the bears failed to break down of the triangle.  The bulls will now try to push prices towards the resistance line of the triangle at $280. The move will gain momentum above $254. The support is way lower at $215. At the moment the risk to reward ratio is not attractive for trades. The LTC/USD pair will become bearish if price breaks down and sustains below the 50-day SMA. As forecast in our previous analysis, the decline to the trendline support prompted buying. NEM is currently in a pullback. Should we trade this?  The traders bought the dip below the trendline support yesterday, Jan. 11. We now expect the XEM/USD pair to rally to $1.56949 and $1.68590, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent fall from $2.06278 to $1.07619. The aggressive traders can buy at the current levels of $1.38 and keep a stop loss at $1.06, below yesterday’s lows. Though the initial risk to reward ratio is not attractive, we believe that buying near the strong support of the trendline is a good strategy. Buyers bought the dip below the trendline on Jan. 11. We had forecast a pullback from the trendline in our previous analysis but advised waiting for a confirmation of a bottom before buying. So, can the traders buy now?  If the pullback sustains above the 0.000057 levels, we expect the move to extend to $0.00006616 and $0.00007221, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent fall. Traders can buy the ADA/BTC pair at the current levels and keep a stop loss at 0.00004. Here too, we are recommending a trade without an attractive risk to reward ratio because we are buying close to the strong support of the trendline from where the price can surprise on the upside.

2018-01-17 01:35:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan 16: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, and Cardano","Cointelegraph No a calm day for the crypto market, with almost all cryptocurrencies down 20% over the last 24 hours. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The past few days have seen a series of flip-flops on news. First was the news of the Korean government banning cryptocurrency trading that led to a sharp fall in prices. Then came the rebuttal that there was going to be no ban in the near future. The latest news from South Korea is that they have still not given up on the plan to shutdown cryptocurrency exchanges. The markets reacted with a selloff in all virtual currencies. The second news was that Ripple had partnered with MoneyGram for money transfers. This shows that the traders should not impulsively buy or sell on any news. It’s always better to wait for a trend to form and then buy into it. Is the current fall a buying opportunity or is there more to go? Let’s find out. For the past four days, the bulls have been attempting to hold the critical support of $12,600 to $12,900 in Bitcoin and push prices back into the symmetrical triangle.  However, the bears did not allow the pullback to cross above the 20-day EMA. Today, when the cryptocurrency broke below $12,500, it attracted huge selling, which resulted in a sharp decline to $11,000, close to the next support of $10,704.99. We believe that the bulls will attempt to pullback from the current levels, but the bounce will not sustain and the BTC/USD pair will crack the $10,704.99 level and fall to $8,000. The 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA have completed a bearish crossover, which is a negative development. Our bearish view will be invalidated if price climbs back above $15,000 levels. In our previous two analysis, we said that Ethereum will find it difficult to breakout of the overhead resistance zone of $1382 and $1434 and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency returned from a high of $1424.3 on Jan. 13.    After maintaining above the $1250 levels for three days, the bears broke down below the support, which attracted profit booking. As a result, the cryptocurrency plunged to $966.64, which is just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally. We also find a negative divergence on the RSI, which is a bearish development. If the support zone between the trendline and $940 holds, we may see an attempt to pullback, which is likely to result in a range bound trading in the next few days. Our view of a trading range in the ETH/USD pair will be invalidated if price breaks below the uptrend line. After trading inside a range of $2072 to $2950 for the past few days, Bitcoin Cash broke down below support.  The pattern target on the BCH/USD pair following the breakdown is $1,194, however, we expect the bulls to attempt to hold $1733 levels, which was the intraday low on Dec. 22. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls succeed in pushing prices back into the range, above $2072.68. We had forecast a possibility of a fall to $1.40 in Ripple on Jan.6. Today, the cryptocurrency touched a low of $1.17.  The correction has broken below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels, which suggests weakness. The cryptocurrency is currently trading inside a descending channel. The downtrend will end when the bulls breakout and sustain above the channel. Though the XRP/USD pair has plunged about 65 percent from its highs, we shall buy it only after it confirms a bottom formation.       There is a tussle between the bulls and the bears at the critical support of $3.03 in IOTA. While the bears have broken below the supports, the bulls are attempting a pullback.  Along with the range, we also located a bearish descending triangle pattern on the IOTA/USD pair, which will complete if the bears manage to sustain below $3.03. Such a breakdown is likely to result in a decline towards the December 22 low of $1.10. On the other hand, if the bulls hold the support, the virtual currency is likely to continue its range bound trading.    Today, Litecoin broke down below the symmetrical triangle pattern and also the 50-day SMA, which is a negative development.  The bulls are attempting to hold the critical support of $175.19. If successful, a return to $230 is likely. On the other hand, if the bears break below $175.19, a move towards $100 is likely. Due to the uncertainty, we are not recommending any trade on the LTC/USD pair. We had suggested a long position in NEM in our previous analysis. The pullback on Jan. 13 did not reach our target levels and our stop loss was triggered today, when the bears broke below the uptrend line.  The bulls are attempting to hold the 50-day SMA, which is close to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. If successful, we may see a pullback towards the trendline, else a fall to $0.59 is possible. We don’t find any setup on the XEM/USD pair, hence, we are not recommending any trade on it. We are carrying long positions in Cardano from 0.00005733 levels. Though price reached our first target of $0.00006616, it could not reach the second target objective of $0.00007221, because it topped out at 0.00006915. So, what should we do now?  Currently, the ADA/BTC pair is holding the critical trendline support. Hence, for the traders who did not sell in the rally on Jan. 13, we recommend closing the position at the current levels. We don’t want to carry a long position when the overall sentiment is heavily bearish because a breakdown of the trendline can extend the fall to 0.00004 levels. A breakout of the downtrend line will be the first indication that the fall is over. The market data is provided by TradingView.

2018-01-20 03:27:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Jan. 19: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano","Cointelegraph Cointelegraph presents the latest trading review on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After a sharp fall, the aggressive bulls jump in and buy at lower levels. This strategy has resulted in huge gains for the cryptocurrency traders in 2017. However, unlike previous occasions, we have not seen a sharp rise this time. This shows that the traders are not confident of a huge rally from the current prices. In the next few days, we expect a range bound action in most of the top cryptocurrencies. We had expected a pullback from the $10,704.99 levels. But Bitcoin overshot on the downside and fell to $9,300 levels.  Currently, the bulls are attempting a reversal, which is likely to carry the cryptocurrency to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern at $13,202 levels. We expect another round of selling from those levels, which is likely to sink the BTC/USD pair back to the support zone of $10,704.99 to $9,300. If this support zone breaks, a fall below $8,000 is likely. On the other hand, if the bulls succeed in holding the support zone, it will lead to a start of a new uptrend. Nimble-footed traders can play the rise, but others should wait for more clarity to develop. We expected the support zone between the trendline and $940 to hold. On Jan. 17, Ethereum broke below the trendline and fell to a low of $770.     The bulls bought the dip aggressively, which has resulted in a pullback that carried the cryptocurrency towards the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent fall from $1424 to $770. For the past three days, the ETH/USD pair has been struggling to cross above $1097. If the price breaks out of the $1100 levels, we expect a move to $1174.36 and $1284.28 levels. As the stop loss is $930, which doesn’t offer a good risk to reward ratio, we are not suggesting any trade on it.   We expected the $1733 levels to hold. Still, the bears easily broke through it and Bitcoin Cash fell to a low of $1364.96 on Jan. 18.  The current increase is likely to face resistance at the $2072 levels, which was the support of the range previously. We shall get a confirmation of a bottom during the next downturn. If $1364.96 breaks, a fall to $1194 is likely. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair sustains above $2072 for a day. We had forecast a fall to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the latest rally, however, Ripple fell close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels, which coincided with the lower end of the descending channel.  The cryptocurrency has broken out of the descending channel, which suggests that the downtrend is over. However, the present increase is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, above which a move to $2.20 is likely. At that price, the XRP/USD pair will face resistance from the trendline that had previously acted as a strong support. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to break above the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to resume the downtrend. Support lies at $0.87. We expect a few days of range bound trading.      IOTA broke down of the bearish descending triangle pattern on January 16, which gives it a pattern target of $1.10.  However, the cryptocurrency took support at $1.93 levels on Jan. 17. Currently, the IOTA/USD pair is retesting the breakout levels of $3.032. If the bulls breakout of the overhead resistance and the downtrend line, our bearish view will be invalidated. However, if the bears defend the $3.032 levels, we are likely to see another bout of selling, which will retest the lows.   We don’t find any clear pattern; hence, we are not recommending any trade.    We had forecast a likely fall to $100 if Litecoin broke below $175.19. It rose from a low of $140.00 on Jan. 17.  For two days in a row, Jan. 16 and Jan. 17, the bears broke down below $175.19 but were unsuccessful in holding prices down. If the bulls breakout of $205, a move to $225 is likely, where both the moving averages converge. This level is likely to act as a resistance.   We don’t find any reasonable trades on LTC/USD pair. NEM fell close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels on Jan. 16 and Jan. 17. Thereafter, the bulls have commenced a pullback, which is likely to face a strong resistance at the downward trendline.  If the price moves above the downtrend line, an increase to $1.45 can’t be ruled out. The next fall towards the recent lows of $0.55134 will confirm whether the bottom is in place or is there further to go. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines on the XEM/USD pair. Cardano broke below the trendline support on Jan. 16 and Jan. 17, however, the bulls defended the support and pushed prices higher quickly.  The ADA/BTC pair broke out of the downtrend line yesterday, Jan. 18, however, it could not pick up momentum. It is struggling to rally above 0.00006. Once bulls breakout of 0.00006, a move to 0.00007 and thereafter to the 0.00008 levels is likely. The cryptocurrency pair will become negative below 0.00004730.

2018-01-24 01:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 23","Cointelegraph Take a look at what orders to place and what buys to avoid. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. When the markets are bullish, a lot of traders only focus on high target levels. This leads to a left out feeling among the ones who have missed out on the rally, and they rush to buy at elevated levels. This results in a huge loss of capital to the uninformed traders. The opposite works when the market falls. One starts to hear bearish voices with the analysts forecasting apocalypse and novice traders get scared and dump their holdings. They buy when they should be selling and sell when they should be buying. Hence, it is always better to take these forecasts with a pinch of salt. We, therefore, avoid giving unrealistic target levels to our readers and try to keep them on the right side of the trade. In our previous analysis, we had predicted that Bitcoin would turn down from the $13,202 levels and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency topped out at $12,988.89 on Jan. 20. It is currently retesting the critical support zone of $10,704.99 to $9,300.    For the past two days, the bulls are defending the $10,000 levels. If this level holds, we may see another attempt to pull back. The trend will turn positive in the short-term only when the BTC/USD pair breaks out of the down trendline 1. This trade should be taken with only 50 percent allocation because on the way up, Bitcoin will face resistance at the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern and at the down trendline 2. On the downside, a break of $10,000 is likely to hurt sentiment, resulting in a decline to $8,000 levels. We had forecast a rally to $1174.36, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent fall from $1424 to $770 and Ethereum topped out at $1,160 on Jan 20.     The price has returned to the trendline support, which has offered strong support since Dec. 10. The bulls have been attempting to hold the trendline support for the past two days. We believe the support zone between $900 and $845 is likely to be defended strongly by the bulls. The ETH/USD pair will indicate a change in trend only after it breaks out of the down trendline. If the above-mentioned support zone breaks, the decline can extend to $770 levels. We don’t find any buy setups; hence, we are not suggesting any trade on it.   In our previous analysis, we had anticipated Bitcoin Cash to return from the $2,072 levels, and it topped out at $2,112.11 on Jan. 20.  The moving average has completed a bearish crossover, and the price is quoting below the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA; which is advantageous to bears. If the retest of the recent lows at $1364.96 fails, a fall to $1194 is likely. If the bulls defend the $1364.96 levels, the BCH/USD pair is likely to become range-bound for a few days. As the trend is still down, we are not suggesting any trade on it. Ripple returned from the 20-day EMA on Jan. 18. It currently has support at the $0.87 levels.  We believe that the XRP/USD pair will become range bound for the next few days between the support of $0.87 and the resistance of $1.74. We shall wait for a breakout above the overhead resistance to initiate any long positions. On the downside, though we expect the $0.87 to hold, it might be reasonable to wait for a bounce before buying. As the trading inside the range is likely to be volatile, we shall only try to buy closer to the supports.       We had mentioned that $3.032 is the critical level for IOTA and a failure to break out above it will attract another bout of selling and that is what happened.  The cryptocurrency is currently attempting to hold the Jan. 16 low of $1.923. If the bears succeed in breaking down this support, a fall to the lows of Dec. 22 of $1.10 is likely. If the bulls hold the $1.923 levels, the IOTA/USD pair is likely to remain range bound for the next few days. It will become positive only if the price breaks out of the down trendline of the descending triangle. Litecoin broke above $205, but could not reach $225, as we had expected. It turned down from $214.48 levels on Jan. 20.  The bears are trying to break down of the critical support level of $175.19. If successful, a fall to $140 is likely. In the short-term, the first sign of bullishness will be when the LTC/USD pair breaks out of $215. Currently, we don’t find any trade set up on it. On Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, the bulls could not sustain above the downtrend line. As a result, NEM has resumed its decline.  Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold the $0.86 level. If this breaks, a fall to the Jan. 16 lows of $0.551 is likely. On the upside, the down trendline is likely to offer strong resistance. The first signs of bullishness will be when price breaks out of the $1.21 levels. We don’t find any trade setups on the XEM/USD pair. Cardano could not break out of the 0.00006 levels. It is now likely to gradually fall to the support levels of 0.000047, and after that to 0.00004070.  For the next few days, we expect the ADA/BTC pair to remain range bound between 0.00004070 on the downside and 0.00006915 on the upside. We shall wait for the pair to bounce from one of the support levels before initiating any trade. At the present levels, we don’t find any bullish setups on it.

2018-01-25 22:01:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 25","Cointelegraph As the market seems to be recovering, see what orders might be a good idea (or not). Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The massive upwards movement in cryptocurrencies over 2017 has not gone unnoticed. The participants at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos are being questioned about cryptocurrencies and Cointelegraph has been one of the main voices representing the fraternity. The traditional investors are still not willing to accept the rising clout of the cryptocurrencies and are pushing for tighter regulation. Only recently, Nordea Bank banned its employees from owning Bitcoin by Feb. 28. However, this move is facing strong opposition from the large unions. Even the fears of a cryptocurrency ban by South Korea gathered a massive petition opposing the move. Finally, the Korean government only banned the traders from using anonymous bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading. The classical investors and regulators fail to understand that these kinds of bans are unlikely to dent the popularity of the cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is currently in no man’s land. It is facing resistance at the down trendline one. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this resistance, we can expect a rally towards the down trendline two. Aggressive traders can trade this pullback. Others should wait for a confirmation of a bottom formation because, if the bulls fail to sustain above the down trendline one, the likelihood of $10,000 levels breakdown increases. Unlike the previous falls, this time, the BTC/USD pair is struggling to hold on to higher levels. With the price quoting below both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA, the trend remains down to range bound. The downtrend will reassert itself if the price breaks down to $10,000 levels. So, the swing traders should wait and watch for the next few days for the trend to change from down to up before initiating any long positions. Ethereum is in a pullback in an uptrend because it is still quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Additionally, it has successfully held on to the uptrend line, which is another positive sign.    But the 20-day EMA has flattened out, which points to a range bound trading action for the next few days. The support of the range is likely to be at $900 levels, whereas, the resistance will be at $1,160 levels. The ETH/USD pair will become negative only after it breaks down of the trendline and the 50-day SMA, which is at $845. Long positions for the medium-term can be initiated on dips to $1,000 levels, with a stop loss at $840. We believe that if the 50-day SMA holds, the cryptocurrency will attempt to resume its uptrend and rally to the highs. This is a risky trade, hence, please keep the position size small. The traders, both the bulls and the bears, are not taking any keen interest in Bitcoin Cash. As a result, it has been trading in a small range since Jan. 23. Support on the downside exists at the Jan. 17 low, $1,364.9657. On the upside, as the moving averages have completed bearish crossover, the 20-day EMA is likely to act as a resistance. Additionally, the $2,072 levels and the downtrend line will also act as a strong overhead resistance. We don’t find any tradable setup on the BCH/USD pair. Ripple has formed a doji candlestick pattern on both Jan. 23 and Jan. 24. Even the price action currently points to a very small range day. As forecast in our previous analysis, the XRP/USD pair is likely to remain range bound between $0.87 and $1.74. A trading opportunity will pop up only if the supports of the range hold or if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the overhead resistance. We should wait until then.       IOTA’s range has been shrinking for the past two days. It has formed successive inside day candlestick patterns on Jan. 23 and Jan. 24. Today, it is trying to resume the downtrend. On the downside, support exists at $1.9232 levels. If this breaks, the IOTA/USD pair can extend its losses to the Dec. 22 low of $1.1. The first signs of a recovery will be seen once the price breaks out of $3.032 and the down trendline of the descending triangle. If the support and the overhead resistance levels hold, we may see a few days of range bound action. Litecoin has held on to the critical support level of $175.199. However, the bounce doesn’t have any strength, which shows a lack of interest in buyers. If the bears succeed in breaking down the supports, a fall to $140.001 is likely. On the other hand, the first signs of a recovery will be on a breakout above $215 levels. Aggressive traders can buy the LTC/USD pair at $187, which is just above the high of past couple of days. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $163 and the target objective is $215. However, this is a very risky trade, hence, please place it only with less than 50 percent of the usual allocation. NEM has held on to the 0.86 levels for the past few days, but the bulls are unable to push prices above the down trendline. This is likely to lead to another attempt to break down of $0.86 within a couple of days. If the bears succeed, a fall to the Jan. 16 lows of $0.55134 is likely. The 20-day EMA has turned down and is likely to complete a bearish crossover if the support breaks. We don’t find any bullish setups on the XEM/USD pair with price trading below the trendline and both the moving averages. A change in trend will be signaled once it rallies above $1.21. Cardano is again attempting to break out of the 0.00006 levels. If successful, it is likely to rally to the overhead resistance at 0.00006915. A very short-term trader can buy at 0.00006 with a stop loss of 0.00005. This is a risky trade, hence, please attempt it with less than 50 percent of the usual position size. Swing traders should wait for a breakout of the 0.00006915 levels to initiate any long positions. We believe that unless the sentiment turns bullish for the cryptocurrencies, the ADA/BTC pair will find it difficult to breakout of the overhead resistance and may drift down to 0.000047 to 0.000049 levels again, which can be a good level to initiate long positions.

2018-01-27 22:08:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 27","Cointelegraph The latest prices overview is served. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After the discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world leaders are getting ready to deliberate on cryptocurrencies in the forthcoming G20 summit in March. Many leaders seek to regulate cryptocurrencies, but if we study the consequences of the Chinese regulations, we find that they have been ineffective. Traders based in China have started trading at cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has only increased the risk for their traders because now they are forced to buy Bitcoin at a premium of about $1,200 compared to other exchanges. The leaders and central banks, instead of blindly opposing cryptocurrencies should chalk out a strategy to embrace them after discussing with the crypto stalwarts. The Bitcoin bulls have been defending the $10,000 mark for the past few days. But they have not been able to push prices higher, which is a point of concern.  The cryptocurrency has broken out of the down trendline one, which shows that the momentum on the downside has decreased. We can expect a few more days of range bound action between $10,000 and $12,000. It is difficult to predict whether the upside or the downside move comes next. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the 20-day EMA, which is currently at $12,218, the BTC/USD pair should rally to the down trendline two. The traders can wait for the breakout above $12,200 to sustain for about 4-hours and then buy with a stop-loss at $9,900. The target objective is a move to $14,500. On the downside, if the bears break below $9,900, the selling is likely to intensify. The next stop on the downside is $8,000. As we are uncertain about the next move, we have elucidated both possibilities. We don’t find any setups as long as the price remains within the range. In our previous analysis, we had recommended long positions in Ethereum on dips to $1,000. Our long positions were triggered yesterday, Jan. 27.      After touching an intraday high of $1,102.4 on Jan. 25, the cryptocurrency fell to the down trendline yesterday, Jan. 26. Now, if it manages to break out of $1,110, we can expect it to rally to $1,174.36 levels. Once the ETH/USD pair breaks out of $1,110, traders should raise the stop loss from the current levels of $840 to $950. That will decrease our risk. Partial profits can be booked at $1,170 levels, and the stops on the remaining positions should be trailed higher. Bitcoin Cash has a history of entering into small range trading days, before a significant breakout or a breakdown. We had seen a similar pattern in August and October last year, 2017.  Currently, the price has been stuck in a tight range of $1,479 on the downside and $1,700 on the upside. Any breakout of this range is likely to face a slew of resistance at the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line and $2,072.6853. On the downside, support is at the January 17th low of $1364.9657 and $1141. We don’t find any tradable setup on the BCH/USD pair. Ripple continues to trade inside the range of $0.87 and $1.74 with a downward bias. If the cryptocurrency breaks down of $1.09 levels, a fall to the lower end of the range is likely.  The XRP/USD pair is struggling to find any buyers. Therefore, we should wait for the cryptocurrency to bounce off the $0.87 lows before initiating any long positions. The probable bearish crossover of the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA is another negative sign. We anticipate the range-bound trading action to continue for the next few days.       Stellar is comparatively stronger cryptocurrency because it is quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA and both are trending higher, whereas, most other top currencies are witnessing a bearish crossover of the moving averages.  If the overall sentiment remains subdued, we believe that the XLM/USD pair will face resistance at the $0.671 mark. Currently, we don’t have a suitable stop loss, so, we’d better wait for a correction to the trendline before initiating any long positions. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of the $0.671 mark, a move towards the highs is likely, with a small resistance at $0.732 levels. It might be a good idea to wait for a low-risk trading opportunity to initiate fresh positions. Litecoin broke below the $175 support level yesterday, Jan. 26, but recovered and closed above it by the end of the day.  What might be worth considering is the fact that the bulls are not able to push prices higher. If we don’t get an upside massive range move within a couple of days, chances are that the bears will again attempt to sink the cryptocurrency. On the downside, support exists at $140.001, which is the intraday low of Jan. 17. If this level also breaks, the LTC/USD pair can sink to the next support level of $85. If the bulls manage to push prices higher, they will face resistance at $200 from the 20-day EMA and at the down trendline of the descending triangle. We should change our bearish view only after price breaks out of $225. NEM broke below the $0.86 levels yesterday, Jan. 26, and made an intraday low of $0.775. However, the bears were not able to capitalize on the breakdown.  Today, we find some buying at the lower levels. The bulls are attempting to break out of the down trendline, which continues to be major resistance. Even if the price breaks out of this, we expect the XEM/USD pair to face resistance at the $1 levels from both the moving averages. The cryptocurrency will become bullish once it breaks out of $1.21 levels. We shall wait for it to turn positive before recommending any long positions. Cardano again failed to break out of 0.00006. That’s why the buy suggested in the previous analysis did not trigger.  The ADA/BTC pair is now likely to fall to the 0.00005 levels, which should act as a support. However, if this level breaks, a fall to 0.00004730 and after that to 0.00004070 can’t be ruled out. We shall wait for the cryptocurrency to turn bullish before recommending any fresh positions.

2018-01-29 21:07:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 29","Cointelegraph See if you should go long or short. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Historically, January has always been a weak month for Bitcoin and 2018 is no exception. Some believe that this is due to Chinese investors converting their Bitcoins to fiat currency in order to buy gifts and presents to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls in February. After all, the Chinese market is one of the major players in the crypto world. However, the same behaviour does not hold true for stocks, because the Hong Kong and Chinese markets have been among the top performers. The equity markets are outperforming the crypto markets, at least in the first month of the year. With only a couple of days more left in January, it remains to be seen if the fortunes of the large cryptocurrencies take a turn in February. Bitcoin turned down from the 20-day EMA on January 28. We had suggested a long position on a close above $12,200, which did not trigger. In the very short-term, we find another descending triangle pattern as shown in the chart. The pattern will complete on a breakdown and close below $9,920 levels. Below this level, we are likely to see further selling pressure by the bears and some long liquidation from the aggressive bulls who have accumulated close to the $10,000 to $12,000 levels expecting a spike up. Panic selling can drag the BTC/USD pair to $8,000 and potentially even further down to $6,000 levels. These lower levels look scary, but please note, we are not trying to instill fear among traders. We are just giving the possible lower levels developing according to the chart patterns. It is important to keep in mind that if Bitcoin breaks out of the $12,000 levels, it will invalidate a bearish pattern; and that is a bullish sign. Therefore, our recommendation is a likely long position at $12250, with a stop loss of $9,900 and a target objective of $14,000. Within the range of $9,900 and $12,200, we don’t find any buy setups. We are holding long positions in Ethereum from $1,000 levels. We had recommended booking partial profits at $1,170 levels, in our previous analysis.      Yesterday, January 28, the Ethereum rallied to an intraday high of $1,265, which is close to 78.6 percent retracement levels of the recent fall from $1,424.3 to $770. Traders can keep a stop loss of $1,000 on the remaining position because if the ETH/USD pair stays above $1,160, it is likely to again attempt a breakout above $1,284.28 levels. If the $1,000 level breaks, Ethereum is likely to slide to the trendline. Yesterday, January 28, Bitcoin Cash broke out of the small overhead resistance at $1,700, but could not continue to build on the gain. The cryptocurrency has again turned back down and has fallen below $1,700 levels. On any upwards movement, the bulls are likely to face strong resistance at the 20-day EMA, which is roughly at the same level as the down trendline. Above this, the next level of resistance is at $2,072.6853. The BCH/USD pair will become positive in the short-term only after it sustains above $2,072.6853. Until then, all pullbacks are likely to be sold. On the downside, a fall below $1,364.9657 will plunge the price to $1,141 levels. We don’t find any buy setups, so we do not recommend any long positions. Currently, Ripple is trading in the center of the range. It is likely to fall to the lower end of the range if it breaks down of the immediate support at $1.09. We expect the XRP/USD pair to remain in the large range of $0.87 to $1.74 for the next few days. We are likely to wait for a dip in support levels or the range breakout to initiate fresh long positions.       With general sentiment across the crypto community remaining weak, Stellar has turned down from the overhead resistance. It is now likely to fall to the trendline support, as we have forecasted in our previous analysis. The 20-day EMA and the trendline support are close - that is why we expect the $0.55 levels to hold. We can initiate long positions once the XLM/USD pair breaks out of the $0.671 mark. We foresee a retest of the highs, with small resistance at $0.732 levels. But if the trendline support breaks, a fall to the 50-day SMA is likely. We shall buy only on a strong rebound off the trendline. Yesterday, January 28, the attempt by the bulls to carry Litecoin higher faced resistance at the 20-day EMA. Now, we anticipate another round of selling by the bears to breakdown below the critical support of $175. If the bears succeed in sustaining below $175, a fall to $140.001 and thereafter to $85 is likely. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair breaks out of the down trendline of the descending triangle. We had forecast that NEM will face resistance at the $1 levels from both the moving averages and that is what happened. If the bears fail to sink the cryptocurrency back below the down trendline, we anticipate a range bound trading between $0.8 on the lower end and $1.2 on the upper end. The XEM/USD pair will become positive in the short-term on a breakout and close above $1.21. Currently, we are unable to find any reliable buy setups on it, so we do not have any recommendations for trading. Cardano is currently trading inside a tight range of 0.00005 and 0.00006. If support of this range breaks, a fall to 0.00004730 and after that to the lower end of the larger range at 0.00004070 is likely. However, if the bulls defend the 0.00005 levels again, the range bound trading action will continue for a few more days. Within this tight range, we are unable to find any bullish pattern, so we do not advise any trading on the ADA/BTC pair.

2018-02-01 01:38:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Jan. 31","Cointelegraph EOS and NEO have joined the club. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. With the news from South Korea confirming government’s positive stance on cryptocurrencies trading, the market still remains volatile. If it doesn’t recover within the next few days, negative news might prompt the bulls selling, that will lead to long liquidation. However, if the bulls succeed in defending the critical support levels, we might see a sharp pullback and the money sitting on the sidelines will rush into the markets, providing a further boost to the upside. We believe that we should see a strong move up or down within the next 3-5 days. Let’s see how we can capitalize on this.    Bitcoin price went down yesterday, January 30, resulting in a sharp decline. Currently, it is finding support just below the critical level of $9,920.02.   Yesterday, January 30, was the first close below the December 22 lows of $10,704.99. This shows that the sellers are gaining an upper hand at lower levels. If the bears build on their advantage and break below the $9,300 levels, we should see a slump to $8,000. If the BTC/USD pair makes a new low, we shall not buy. However, if the bulls regroup themselves and buy aggressively, pushing prices above the downtrend line, it will signal a likely reversal. That’s why we suggest buying on a close above $12,200 with an initial stop loss of $9,600. We expect the bounce to face strong resistance at $14,000 levels. Though this trade doesn’t offer a good risk to reward ratio, we suggest taking it because the goal to buy as close to the bottom as possible. We should close the position quickly if it doesn’t gain momentum above $12,200. As the chances of a whipsaw are high, please keep the allocation size at 50 percent of normal. Ethereum continues to be strong as it is still trading above the uptrend line and above both moving averages. We are holding 50 percent of our original purchase done at $1,000 levels with the stops at breakeven. We remain bullish on the ETH/USD pair because it continues to form a higher low on the charts. This shows that the bulls are eager to buy on dips, so they don’t let prices fall. But the up move is facing profit booking at higher levels. As a result, the 20-day EMA has turned flat, which points to a consolidation in the short-term. The 50-day SMA continues to rise indicating the uptrend continuation. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency plunges below the uptrend line and the 50-day SMA.   Bitcoin Cash is down around 64 percent from its peak of $4,139.0893, that was reached on December 20, 2017. $1,364.9657 is an important support level on the downside. If the BCH/USD pair breaks below this, we anticipate a fall to $1,150 levels, which is the next major support. If this level holds, the bulls will attempt to break out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. In case they succeed, we can expect the cryptocurrency to remain range-bound between $1,364.9657 and $2,072.6853. Ripple continues to be under pressure. It is unable to settle at any support level. Currently, it is taking support at the psychological level of $1. If this level breaks down, we can expect a slide to the lower end of the range at $0.87. If we find strong buying emerge at this support level, we may consider initiating long positions. Until then, we don’t find any buy setups on the XRP/USD pair, so we don’t recommend any trade on it.        Stellar has broken down of the trendline immediate support and the price is quoting below the 20-day EMA. Its next support is at the 50-day SMA and below it at the $0.41 levels. On the upside, the XLM/USD pair is likely to face resistance at the trendline and the recent swing high at $0.634 levels. Initiating long positions only above $0.65 levels might be a good move in this case. Litecoin broke below the critical support of $175, which completes the bearish descending triangle pattern. The bears are likely to push the price down to $140.001 and after that to $85 levels. On the other hand, the bulls will try to quickly reclaim the $175 levels. The LTC/USD pair will turn positive only after it crosses the downtrend line. It might be a good idea to wait for the trend to change before suggesting any trade. NEM has turned down after failing to break out of the moving averages. It is currently trying to hold the support at the downtrend line 1. If this support breaks, we might see a fall to the $0.60. The XEM/USD pair will show signs of bottoming out once it breaks out of the downtrend line 2 and sustains above $1.1. It seems reasonable to wait for a reliable buy setup to form before initiating any long positions on it. NEO has been in a strong uptrend since December 2017. During the recent correction, it has not given up much ground, which makes it a relative outperformer. It is quoting above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, which is a bullish sign. It has formed a symmetrical triangle, which is a continuation pattern. A breakout of this pattern might resume the uptrend and carry the NEO/USD pair to the highs and then towards its target objective of $275. This way long positions can be initiated at $170 and the stop loss can be kept at $130. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency breaks down of the triangle, which can push it down towards the support zone of $85 to $100. EOS is in an uptrend from November 2017. The price has bounced off the trendline on four occasions. Currently, the price has again declined to the trendline. The 50-day SMA is also placed at the same level, and we expect the bulls to defend $10.5 levels. However, any pullback from the trendline will face resistance at the $14 levels. We expect a few more days of consolidation before a breakout. Long positions might be initiated if the EOS/USD pair holds the trendline for the next couple of days. In case the cryptocurrency breaks below the trendline, our bullish view will be invalidated.

2018-02-02 20:44:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, February 2, 2018","Cointelegraph An analytical overview on cryptocurrencies prices, their movements and orders. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. There are various reasons behind the panic currently gripping the crypto world – increased regulations, hacking, and crackdown by various governments. Additionally, the last leg of the rally looked frothy as traders gobbled up cryptocurrencies at crazy levels out of fear of missing out on the rally. But when the mainstream media highlights negative news, investor sentiment is affected and some traders panic and dump their positions out of fear of losing their capital. Some analysts believe that the bubble in cryptocurrencies has burst, while the others believe that the current fall is a great long-term buying opportunity. We consider the recent fall as a great buying opportunity. However, all cryptocurrencies will not rise equally from their current levels, as markets will start distinguishing between different cryptocurrencies. Therefore, we should look to buy stronger currencies that have fallen less and are bouncing off sharply from their key support levels. Let’s explore which cryptocurrencies are showing signs of a pullback. Bitcoin is in a firm bear grip. It has declined about 55 percent from its high. With the recent fall, the cryptocurrency has retraced close to 78.6 percent of the latest leg of the rally. We find first signs of buying at $8000 levels.  In 2017, the RSI fell to the oversold levels (about 30) on three occasions and all of them proved to be a good buying opportunity. Presently, the RSI is close to the oversold levels. Therefore, there is a greater likelihood of a bottom formation around the current levels. Aggressive traders can buy between $8,600 to $8,600 and keep a stop loss of $7,800. The pullback can lift the BTC/USD pair to the overhead resistance of about $10,700. We anticipate another round of selling in the resistance zone of $10,700 to $11,300 (at the 20-day EMA). Therefore, traders should book partial profits at $10,500 levels and trail the rest. This is a risky trade and should be attempted with less than 50 percent of the usual position size. The next leg down will confirm a bottom in the cryptocurrency, if it doesn’t break the recent lows of $8,000. If the lows break, the downtrend can extend to $6,000 levels. Therefore, we recommend that long-term traders should wait for a couple of days before buying.   Our stop loss on the long positions in Ethereum was hit at $1,000. It could not escape the panic that has gripped the cryptocurrency market.  Today, the ETH/USD pair broke below the uptrend line, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. It finally took support at $768, just below the panic low of $770 hit on January 17 2018. The pullback from the lows is likely to face resistance at $1,025 levels. At the current levels, the risk to reward ratio is not attractive. Therefore, we are not recommending making any trades on this currency. However, if the next fall towards the $820 to $770 level holds, we suggest long positions with a SL at $700.   Bitcoin Cash has completely retraced the last leg of the rally. It has slumped about 73 percent from its peak.    In our previous analysis, we forecasted that if the $1,364.9657 level breaks, a fall to $1,150 is likely and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $1,000 where buying emerged. The pullback can carry the BCH/USD pair to the downtrend line, where we anticipate another round of selling. Bitcoin Cash has been a laggard; hence, we want to see a further confirmation of a bottom formation before recommending any trade. We are most likely to recommend a long position if the support zone of $1,150 to $1,000 holds during the next fall. Ripple has taken the current fall on the chin. At the day’s intraday low of $0.61, it had declined 81.5 percent from lifetime highs of $3.317.  The momentum was so strong that the critical support level of $0.87, which had acted as a strong support on January 16 and January 17 also failed. The XRP/USD pair fell close to the next support level of $0.61, which is the final support, below which, a fall to $0.24 is likely. The current pullback should reach the downtrend line which should offer a strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive, so we don’t suggest any trade on it.          Stellar has broken below the 50-day EMA. At the days intraday it also broke below $0.41 and fell towards the final support of $0.296.  Strong buying at the lower levels helped the cryptocurrency pull back above the critical support of $0.41. If the level holds, we may see a range bound action on the XLM/USD pair for the next few days. Steller will likely become a buy once it breaks out of the upper end of the range at $0.64. We are not recommending a buy today because a pullback of a single day cannot confirm a bottom. After breaking the critical support of $175, the bulls failed to hold the $140.001 levels and  Litecoin fell to a low of $107.102.  Strong buying at the lows is likely to carry the LTC/USD pair towards the overhead resistance of $175. However, the cryptocurrency has been weak and its logical support is way lower at $84.708. Therefore, we don’t recommend any long positions on it.   NEM has declined about 74 percent from the highs. It has found some buying support at $0.45747, just below the critical level of $0.49.  The pullback should reach the downtrend line, which should offer strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive and the XEM/USD pair has been an underperformer. Therefore, we want to wait for a further confirmation of a bottom before cherry picking. During the next retest of the low, if the $0.45 level breaks, a slide down to the next support of $0.3672 is likely. NEO broke below the symmetrical triangle on February 1 2018. Today (February 2), it fell close to the critical support level of $93.53 which resulted in strong buying by the bulls.  The pullback in the NEO/USD pair has reached close to the breakdown point of $132, which should offer a strong resistance level. NEO is one of the stronger cryptocurrencies in the top 10 list because it is still quoting above the 50-day SMA. We consider that it might be better to buy NEO during the next fall to $105 levels. We were expecting the trendline to provide some support, but the bears easily broke down below it. EOS found buying support at the $8.4 levels, close to the critical support zone of $7.5 to $6.5.  The EOS/USD pair is comparatively strong because it is also quoting above its 50-day SMA. Aggressive traders can buy on any dips towards $9 and keep a SL of $7.4. The profit objective on the upside is a rally to $14 levels. We recommend that the long-term traders, however, should wait for a buy set up to form before initiating any long positions. Note: - Bottoms are not formed in a single day. After such a steep decline, we are likely to see a pullback and a few days of volatile price action. Therefore, we have suggested only a few trades and that too only for the aggressive trader. The long-term traders should wait for a successful retest of the lows before buying.

Following the huge decline in 2018, the top 5 credit card companies have either banned or have announced a ban on cryptocurrency purchases using credit cards. As a result, late entrants to the rally, who had purchased cryptocurrency using borrowed money and are nursing losses of more than 50 percent will now be forced to square up their positions. This is likely to result in another round of panic selling, which will shake out the weak hands. These lower levels will attract a new set of investors who believe in the technology and have been waiting to invest at the right opportunity. Let us identify these lower levels that can attract buyers. On February 02, Bitcoin saw some buying at the $8,000 levels. However, the pullback failed to reach our target objective of $10,700 for the short-term traders. We anticipated a pullback to the 20-day EMA, but in a selling frenzy, the pullbacks only lasted around 1-3 days. After a day of recovery, the cryptocurrency has turned down once again. Today, the price has broken below the low formed on February 2. If the bears succeed in sustaining below the $8,000 levels, the BTC/USD pair is likely to slide down to $6,239, which is the pattern target from the break of the descending triangle. Below this, the fall can extend to the $5,450 levels, which will effectively retrace 100 percent of the latest leg of the rally. We believe that the panic selling to the above-mentioned levels offers a good buying opportunity to the long-term investors. However, investors should scale into the positions instead of buying all at once. We recommend buying about 30 to 40 percent of the desired allocation in the range of $5,500 to $5,800.    In our previous analysis, we expected some resistance at the $1,025 levels. On February 3, Ethereum turned down from a high of $999. We had also suggested long positions on a decline to the $770 to $820 levels with a stop loss of $700. We still believe that the $770 to $785 range is a strong support zone for the ETH/USD pair, however, if this support zone breaks, a slide to $640 is likely. The 78.6 percent retracement of the latest leg of the rally is at $611.34 levels. Hence, we foresee strong buying in the zone of $611.34 to $640. However, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA are likely to complete a bearish crossover, which is a negative development. Therefore we do not recommend any fresh trades.   We expected Bitcoin Cash to pull back to the downtrend line, but it turned down from $1,316.07 levels. Today, it has broken below the $1,000 support. Now, it is likely to fall to the next critical support of $854.3135. We do not find any signs of a bottom on the BCH/USD pair barring the fact that the RSI is close to entering into the oversold territory. Despite this, we want to see some buying emerge before making any trade on it. Ripple is also retesting the lows formed on February 2. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, it has still not fallen below the February 2 low of $0.63252. This points to likely exhaustion of selling in the XRP/USD pair. Also, the $0.61 is the final support. After this time, we may see a further fall to $0.24 levels. It will become positive in the short-term after it breaks out of the downtrend line. Until then, all pullbacks are likely to be sold by the bears.          Stellar could not build on the sharp pullback of February 2. It has again broken below the support of $0.41 and is likely to retest the critical support of $0.296. If this support breaks, the XLM/USD pair is likely to fall to the support line of the descending channel, which should offer strong support. If this level also breaks, a fall to $0.1 might take place. We recommend waiting for the trend to change from down to up before initiating any fresh positions. The pullback in Litecoin was stronger than the other cryptocurrencies because it reached close to the 20-day EMA. This shows interest in buying at the lower levels. If the bulls accumulate the price close to levels between $107 and $120 levels, it will point to a possible bottom. We might be interested in getting the LTC/USD pair if it breaks out of the $175 levels. On the other hand, if the bears succeed in breaking below the lows of February 2, a fall to the final support of $84.708 is likely. Due to this uncertainty, we do not recommend any long positions on Litecoin at the moment.   NEM is retesting the lows formed on February 2. If the bulls manage to hold the lows, a move towards the downtrend line might take place. If the lows breakdown, we are most likely to see a fall to the next support level of $0.31672. The XEM/USD pair will become positive in the short-term once it sustains above the downtrend line.    Until today, NEO had been a relative outperformer as it was still trading above the 50-day SMA. Today, it has broken below the 50-day SMA, the critical support of $93.53 and the low formed February 2. It still holds minor support at $86.143, below which it can fall to $64.83 levels. If this level also fails to hold, the NEO/USD pair can fall to $27.13, which is the target objective on the breakdown from the symmetrical triangle pattern. Considering this recent weakness, we recommend holding any trades until further notice. We had recommended a long position in EOS on dips to $9 with a stop loss of $7.4. Our profit objective was $14, but the pullback topped out at $11.25. The EOS/USD pair has again declined towards the critical support zone of $6.5 to $7.4. We expect this level to hold, but it is prudent to not take any fresh positions until the charts forecast a short-term bottom.

2018-02-07 17:23:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple’s Global Financial Network Partners With China-Based Payment Provider,"Cointelegraph LianLian, a Chinese payment services provider, and RippleNet have announced a partnership designed to speed up transactions between China and RippleNet users in the US and Europe. News LianLian International, a China-based payment services provider, has partnered with RippleNet in order to offer faster and less expensive cross border transactions to their customers across the US, Europe, and China, according to a Feb. 7 announcement on Ripple’s blog. RippleNet is Ripple’s decentralized global network, made up of banks and other financial institutions, that handles the real-time confirmations of financial transactions. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, tweeted that Ripple “just opened the door to the largest e-commerce market in the world”: We just opened the door to the largest e-commerce market in the world for our #RippleNet partners with LianLian. https://t.co/R3HyqxhF9U LianLian will use Ripple’s centralized software payment solution, xCurrent, which is tailored to work with financial institutions by allowing banks to confirm payment details in real time before each transaction and after each delivery. LianLian already lists PayPal and Apple as their strategic partners, serving marketplaces like Amazon, Ali Express, and Ebay. In reference to the Ripple partnership, Arthur Zhu, CEO of LianLian, said: “With RippleNet, we will further enhance that experience and increase our market share by offering customers instant, blockchain-powered payments across the 19 currencies that we currently support. We look forward to working with Ripple to power payment flows between China and RippleNet members in new markets.” Ripple has partnerships with over 100 financial institutions, most recently partnering in mid-January with Moneygram to speed up fiat payments. The RippleNet and LianLian partnership comes at a time when China has been increasing crypto regulation, removing crypto-related ads on social media and search engines and banning foreign exchanges on top of the earlier domestic exchange restrictions.

2018-02-07 20:32:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, NEM, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, February 7 2018","Cointelegraph See if we can find signs of bullishness in the cryptocurrency market. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After the clampdown in China and South Korea to cryptocurrency trading, there were fears that the US will also follow suit. However, the testimony of Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allayed these fears. They were much more realistic and supportive of cryptocurrencies than what the market had expected. As a result, most cryptocurrencies are currently in a sharp pullback, after days of weakness. Even after the recent plunge, some analysts believe that the cryptocurrencies will enter into a strong bull market that is forecast to be at least as strong as 2017. Let’s see if we can find signs of bullishness in the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. We had previously recommended buying Bitcoin in the range of $5,500 to $5,800 on panic selling. It came close to our buy level, but did not reach there. It bottomed out on February 6 at $6,075.04.    The cryptocurrency is finding buyers at lower levels who are using the sharp plunge in prices to buy for the long-term. So, is the downtrend over or will the market resume its fall after a short pullback? During a strong downtrend, a 1 to 3-day pullback can be expected. The counter-trend move usually faces selling at the 20-day EMA or at previous supports, which now act as resistance. The BTC/USD pair is likely to face resistance at $9,500, which was the high on February 3. Above this, a move to $9,920 can’t be ruled out, but we expect the range of $9,920 to $10,700 to act as a strong resistance. We believe that the cryptocurrency will turn down from one of the above-mentioned levels. If the retest of the lows is successful, we may add long positions for the long-term. If the lows break, we’ll have to wait for a few more days.    In our previous analysis, we expected a strong support at the $611.34 to $640 zone. Ethereum bottomed out at $565.54 on February 6.  This pullback is likely to face resistance at the current levels. If the ETH/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line, we might see a rally towards the $967 levels, where both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA converge. We anticipate a turnaround from one of these levels. If the next downward trend takes support between $770 to $640, it will indicate a bottom. However, if the bears breakdown below $565, a fall to $390 can’t be ruled out, but we consider this unlikely.   Bitcoin Cash bottomed out at $778.2021, just below the critical support of $854. However, the pullback from the lows does not instill confidence.      After the steep decline, we believe that the BCH/USD pair will enter a period of consolidation before embarking on an upward trend. The current pullback is likely to face resistance between $1150 and $1325 levels, from the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. We should turn bullish in the long-term only on a sustained move above the downtrend line. Ripple broke below its critical support of $0.61, but quickly recovered from $0.5627 levels. The pullback might face resistance at the previous support of $0.87.  Above this, the XRP/USD pair will face a strong resistance at the downtrend line. We’ll look to buy if the downward trend finds support between $0.87 and $0.61 levels. Stellar broke below the $0.296 critical support on February 6, but it did not fall to the support line of the descending channel.  Similar to the other cryptocurrencies, the XLM/USD pair is currently in a pullback, which will probably  face resistance at $0.41; this level was previously acting as strong support. We may have a positive outlook on Stellar once it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. We mentioned in our previous analysis that the recovery in Litecoin was stronger than other cryptocurrencies. While the other cryptocurrencies broke to new lows on February 6, the LTC/USD pair held on to its February 2 lows, which is a sign of strength.  If the recovery breaks out of $175, it will indicate a double bottom in the short-term, which gives it an upside target objective of $243. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has a slew of overhead resistances between $168 and $185. Hence, we anticipate a few days of range bound action between $107 and $175. We recommend looking to buy once the pair moves above $185.   NEM fell to a low of $0.36476 on February 6, close to the critical support of $0.31672.  Currently, it is close to the downtrend line, which will probably offer strong resistance. The downtrend will be over once the XEM/USD pair sustains above the downtrend line. We recommend waiting for a buy setup to form before making any purchases. We had forecast NEO to fall to $64.83 levels in our previous analysis and on February 6, it bottomed out at $63.62.  NEO has seen one of the sharpest pullbacks among the top cryptocurrencies. Still, it can face resistance between $111 and $123, from the moving averages. We’d better wait for the NEO/USD pair to hold above the $93 levels in the next leg down to start purchasing it. We had forecast that the $6.5 to $7.4 zone will act as strong support, and on February 6, EOS bottomed out at $5.7917.  Right now it is trading inside a tight descending channel. If it breaks out of the resistance line of the channel, it’ll possibly rally to the $10.7 levels, where both moving averages converge. If the EOS/USD pair holds above $7.5 levels in the next fall, we may place purchase orders.

2018-02-10 00:37:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 09","Cointelegraph A technical analysis of cryptocurrencies price and their short-term movements. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange Cryptocurrencies are a part of evolving technology and are still in a nascent stage.So, they are likely to remain quite volatile compared to the other matured asset classes. The early investors in cryptocurrencies were mostly technology enthusiasts who saw a future in them. After the humongous returns of 2017, more and more institutional investors want to join the party. This is changing the way the cryptocurrencies perform. In the past 90-days, the correlation between the S&P 500 and cryptocurrencies has risen sharply to 33 percent, which is way above the previous high reading of 19 percent, according to Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. The long-term average is way lower at 1 percent. 2018 has turned out to be hugely negative to both the stock market and the cryptocurrencies. Let’s see if the top coins point towards a resumption of the downtrend, similar to the S&P 500. While it is better to trade with the trend, at times, strong counter-trend rallies can also be profitable. Bitcoin is trading inside a descending channel with both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA trending down. This shows that it is in a confirmed downtrend. The current pullback is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA.  In a downtrend, when the selling is overdone, and prices reach attractive levels, it can offer a short-term trading opportunity. We believe that if the BTC/USD pair holds above the February 06 lows during the next leg down, the traders will have an opportunity to enter long positions. The ideal time to buy would be when prices break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. The profit objective of such a trade will be a move towards the resistance line of the descending channel. However, if the price breaks down and goes on to make a new low, the above-mentioned trading opportunity will be invalidated.    Ethereum plunged from $1,265 levels to $565.54 levels within nine days. The February 06 low also coincided with the support line of the descending channel.    The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, which points to the possibility of another leg down. We expect the current leg of the pullback to face resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the ETH/USD pair stays above the February 06 lows, it will point to a possible short-term bottom, which can be purchased. We should avoid the trade if the cryptocurrency sinks to new lows.   Yesterday, Bitcoin Cash made a strong move up. It is now likely to move towards the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA where it might face strong resistance.      The BCH/USD pair will become positive in the short-term once it breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line. We expect it to form a bullish setup in the next few days. The first target objective is a move to $2,072 levels. We currently don’t find any bullish pattern; hence, we do not recommend any trade on it.   Ripple has caused a lot of heartburn to its investors. At the current price, it is still down about 67 percent from its peak. It has been trading in a small range for the past five days and is not finding much interest among the buyers.  However, we believe that if the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line, we can expect it to attract further buying, which can propel it towards the overhead resistance of $1.74. Therefore, we need to wait for a breakout above the 20-day EMA before buying. Our view of a short-term bottom will prove to be wrong if the cryptocurrency breaks down of the lows formed on February 06.          Stellar has become range bound for the past three days. Intraday, it is facing resistance at the previous support of $0.41.  A break above this level will again face selling at the resistance line of the descending channel. The trend on the XLM/USD pair will change only after it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. Stellar will become negative if it sustains below $0.30 levels. Litecoin is close to the 20-day EMA, which has acted as strong resistance on two previous occasions.  If the bulls break out of this level, they are likely to face another round of selling around the $175 mark, which has dual resistance, from the downtrend line and the horizontal line. Once the LTC/USD pair breaks out of these resistances, it will probably start a new uptrend, which can carry it to $243 and after that to $307. Traders can initiate long positions once the cryptocurrency breaks out and sustains above the $175 levels. We don’t have a specific stop loss position. We can update the same one once our buy levels are triggered. Cardano is not finding buyers. It continues to struggle near the lows formed on February 02. It has also formed a descending triangle pattern, which is a bearish setup.    If the ADA/BTC pair breaks down and sustains below the horizontal support of 0.00004070, it will complete the descending triangle formation. After that, it will most likely slide to 0.0000246 levels where buying should emerge. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks out and closes above the downtrend line of the triangle.    NEO is facing resistance at the moving averages, as outlined in our previous analysis. Additionally, it formed an inside day pattern yesterday, February 08, and it is likely to repeat the same pattern today.  These successive inside day patterns have the same effect as the coiling of the spring. Once the bulls breakout above $120 levels, a quick rally to the downtrend line at $140 might take place. Traders can keep an initial stop loss of $100, which can be trailed higher to reduce the risk. On the other hand, if the NEO/USD pair breaks down instead of breaking out, it will become negative, and a retest of the February 06 lows is likely. EOS has broken out of the descending channel, which points to a waning bearish momentum. However, it has been facing resistance close to the $8.97 mark for a couple of days. A break above this level is likely to propel the cryptocurrency higher towards $10 and then to $12.  Very short-term traders can initiate a long position in the EOS/USD pair at $9 and keep an SL of $7.5. Still, this is a very risky trade; traders should use only 50 percent of their usual allocation.

2018-02-12 23:42:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 12","Cointelegraph Cryptocurrencies are going up, have you placed your orders already? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The cryptocurrency market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. While a buy and hold strategy has proven to be beneficial to the early Bitcoin investors, the late entrants have used the wild price swings to add to their Bitcoin numbers. We can see from the charts in this article that the whales have increased their Bitcoin holdings over the past couple of years. In these price swings, an average trader buys at the highs and sells at the lows. We have been trying to help our readers avoid this pitfall. All along through this fall, we have refrained from suggesting aggressive long positions. But, do we find a short-term bottom now? Let’s see. We were expecting Bitcoin to retest the lows after turning down from the trendline. But the bears could not break below the $8,000 mark.   Currently, the price is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line and above it, at the 20-day EMA. We expect the $8,600 to $9,400 levels to be a real test for the bulls. If they succeed in breaking out of this zone, a quick rally to $12,000 might take place, where it will again face resistance from the 50-day SMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. Therefore, the traders can wait for a breakout above $9,500 to buy. The stop loss for the trade should be kept at $7,800. The profit objective is a move to $12,000. And what if the BTC/USD pair fails to break out of $9,500 and turns down once again? In this case, traders should wait, resisting the urge to buy at lower levels because if the price breaks below $7,800, we might see it go down to the $7,000 point. We always provide both the bullish and bearish scenarios because the traders should be aware of what to expect in both cases. It would be irresponsible to provide levels only in one turn of events.    After a two-day dip on Feb. 10 and Feb. 11, Ethereum is also attempting to move up.   The ETH/USD pair is likely to face resistance at $911 from the 20-day EMA and at $980 from the 50-day SMA. Above these levels, the price may move to the resistance line of the descending channel, at about $1,050 levels. On the downside, $775 has strong support. It doesn’t provide good risk to reward ratio, so we are not suggesting a trade on it. Bitcoin Cash has been trading in a small range for the past four days. It might resolve with a large range day, either to the upside or downside.     If the large range day goes downside, we’d better avoid doing anything. But if the BCH/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, it will signal a short-term bottom, which can be traded. Therefore, we think a long position at $1,400 with a stop loss of $1,100 might be a smart move. The profit objective of this trade is a rally to the $1,925 - $2,000 levels.   We had written about the possibility of a short-term bottom in Ripple. We have been waiting for a rally above the 20-day EMA to initiate long positions. On Feb. 10, the XRP/USD pair broke out of the 20-day EMA but could not sustain higher levels. Right now, it is again at the 20-day EMA. We believe that if the bulls sustain above the $1.1 levels for four hours, we can expect a rally towards the 50-day SMA at $1.5. If this level is crossed, a move to $1.74 is likely. The traders can keep a stop loss at the $0.86 levels, which is just below the previous support. Ripple has been an underperformer in the current fall, hence, please trade with only 50 percent of the usual position size.          Stellar has continued its range-bound trading action for the past few days. Attempts to rally have been facing strong resistance at the $0.41 levels. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the descending channel, we anticipate a rally to the $0.63 levels. We don’t find any long trade until the XLM/USD pair trades inside the channel. On the downside, if the cryptocurrency breaks down of $0.3 on a closing basis (as per UTC), it can slide to the support line of the channel. Therefore, we’d better wait for a breakout of the channel to initiate any long positions. We had advised on long positions in Litecoin if the breakout sustains above the $175 levels. However, for the past three days, the bulls have been struggling to clear the 20-day EMA hurdle. If the price breaks out of $175, it will clear the resistance from the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line, and the horizontal line. We believe that this is a significant development. That’s we reiterate our recommendation to initiate long positions if the LTC/USD pair holds above the $178 levels for four hours. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $130. On the upside, $200 is resistance. If the cryptocurrency struggles at this level, we should close the position or tighten the stops. Once the bulls break out of $200, we might see a rally to $307. Cardano continues to trade inside the descending triangle pattern. This is a bearish setup, and a breakdown of the support at 0.00004070 will complete the pattern.   Though the target of this breakdown is way lower, we expect the ADA/BTC pair to find buying support at the 0.0000246 levels. Failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. Therefore, if the cryptocurrency turns up and breaks out of the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA, we need to reverse our position and go long. Until then, consider staying away from it.    In our previous analysis, we had recommended a long position on NEO above $120 levels with a stop loss of $100.   Though the price reached an intraday high of $120.33 on Feb. 10, it could not settle at the levels. Therefore, traders should wait for the price to sustain for at least four hours before buying the breakouts. On the downside, $93.53 again acted as strong support yesterday, Feb. 11. The NEO/USD pair is stuck in a range of $93.5 on the downside and $120 on the upside. A breakout of this range is likely to propel the cryptocurrency towards the downtrend line of the descending triangle. Traders can buy on a breakout above $121 if the price sustains the level for at least four hours. The initial stop loss should be kept at $93, which should be trailed higher if the bulls fail to break out of the triangle downtrend line. But in case, if the NEO turns down from the moving averages and breaks down of the $93.53 levels, it might become negative. We had recommended a short-term trade on EOS at $9 with a target objective of $10 and $12. The cryptocurrency came very close to our target as it topped out at $9.9 on Feb. 10. Hope the traders trailed their stops higher and closed out the trade at least at breakeven prices. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the 20-day EMA is trending down. It is likely to offer strong resistance at the $10 levels. On the downside, the $7.5 to $6.5 levels will act as strong support. We don’t find any reliable trade setups at the current levels, so no suggestions on new trades with the EOS/USD pair.

The first of its kind to be launched by a central bank, the pilot program will allow participating KSA banks to use xCurrent for cross-border payment payments. SAMA will support KSA banks with a regulatory sandbox, program management and training. Dilip Rao, Ripple’s global head of infrastructure innovation, said: “Central banks around the world are leaning into Blockchain technology in recognition of how it can transform cross-border payments, resulting in lower barriers to trade and commerce for both corporates [sic] and consumers.” Rao added, “SAMA is leading the charge as the first central bank to provide resources to domestic banks that want to enable instant payments using Ripple’s innovative blockchain solution.” Ripple has partnerships with over 100 financial institutions, most recently last week partnering with LianLian International, a China-based payment services provider.

2018-02-14 23:03:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, February 14 2018","Cointelegraph The cryptomarket stands strong, with all top 9 coins moving up. The question is how high? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Regulators around the world are trying to stifle the popularity of cryptocurrencies. But every time they do this, the crypto world bounces back bigger and stronger than ever before. Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of Kraken, believes that the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies will more than double from the current levels and reach the $1 trillion USD milestone by the end of the year. However, as the market matures, it will start differentiating between cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse believes that many will sink to zero because they don’t have anything worthwhile to offer. But is there no way to stop the pump and dump that is the usual feature in some of the smaller coins? Lon Wong, president of NEM, believes that nothing much can be done about price manipulation until the market matures. As traders, we always keep a protective stop loss to safeguard our capital and because the crypto markets are open 24/7, the risks of a gap down opening are nonexistent. So, our readers need not worry even if prices of a few cryptocurrencies drop to zero. Let’s see if we find bullish setups on any of the top 9 coins. Bitcoin is attempting to extend its recovery, but it is likely to face a strong resistance from the current levels to the $9,500 mark, from the downtrend line, the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance.    There are two possibilities – the price will either break out or turn down from here. Do we know for sure which one will happen? No. So, we should be ready for both scenarios. If the BTC/USD pair breaks out of $9,500 and sustains for four hours, it confirms a breakout and we recommend long positions with a stop loss of $7,800. Our first target is a move to the 50-day SMA, which currently is at about $11,780. Above this, we might see a move to the resistance line of the descending channel. Secondly, if the price turns down from $9,500 and breaks below $7,800, a slide to $7,000 is likely. As we don’t have a confirmation of a bottom yet, it is recommended to keep the position size only 50 percent of usual.     Ethereum formed an inside day candlestick pattern yesterday, February 13. Today, it is trying to extend the pullback.    The recovery looks strong as the ETH/USD pair has not given up much ground since bottoming out on February 6, at $565.54. Overhead resistance is at the 20-day EMA at $902 and the 50-day SMA at $985, whereas support is at $775. Aggressive traders can initiate long positions once the price sustains above $902 for four hours. The positions should be closed at the 50-day SMA, if the cryptocurrency struggles to break out of it, else a move to the resistance line of the descending channel, around the $1,050 to $1,100 mark might happen. Since the large range move on February 8, Bitcoin Cash has been trading in a small range. As most cryptocurrencies are showing signs of a recovery, we expect this consolidation to resolve on the upside.      The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies. Therefore, we want to take this trade. Currently, the price has broken out of the downtrend line and the descending channel, but it is yet to clear the 20-day EMA, which is at $1,351. We recommend a buy at $1,400. The up move can extend to the 50-day SMA at $1,860 and thereafter to $2,000. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $1,100.   Ripple has been trading in a tight range for the past four days. It is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA. If it breaks out of this, we expect it to gain momentum.  Therefore, we had recommended a long position on the XRP/USD pair in our previous analysis. We reiterate our buy call because with most of the cryptocurrencies moving up, we believe that a rally to $1.50 and thereafter to $1.74 is possible. However, we recommend buying only after the digital currency sustains above $1.08 levels for four hours. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down of $0.86.          Stellar is also showing signs of a change in trend. It has broken out of the overhead resistance at $0.41 and is currently at the resistance line of the descending channel.  Once the price sustains above the channel, it will signal a change in trend and a move to $0.63 is likely. We recommend a long position on the XLM/USD pair at $0.45 with a stop loss at $0.30 on daily closing basis (as per UTC time frame). We note that the resistance at the 50-day SMA should be watched carefully. If the bulls struggle to breakout of this, it is prudent to close the position. We have been bullish on Litecoin for the past few days. We had recommended a long position in it in our previous analysis. Our trade triggered today and our readers would have entered long positions at $180. The break out above $175 has completed a short-term double bottom, which has a minimum target objective of $242.  The LTC/USD pair has cleared the immediate overhead resistance from the 50-day SMA; it is a bullish sign. The price should now rally to $242 and thereafter to $307 levels. We had previously recommended a stop loss of $130. However, post the breakout, the stops should be raised to $140. We’d better keep trailing the stops higher because we don’t want to hang on to the trade if it falls back below $175. Cardano is not finding any buyers. It is looking weak and a breakdown from the bearish descending triangle pattern looks possible.    The price has broken down of the critical support of 0.00004070. Unless the bulls quickly climb above this level, there might be a fall to the next support level of 0.0000246. Our bearish view on the ADA/BTC pair will be invalidated if the price breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle.    NEO has reached the critical overhead resistance of $120 from where it has returned on three previous occasions. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of this level, we might see a move towards the downtrend line of the descending triangle pattern.     We retain our recommendation for a buy call given on the NEO/USD pair in our previous analysis. Traders can go long once the price sustains above $121 for four hours. The stop loss can be kept at $100. Target objective is a rally to $140. EOS has reached a critical resistance zone of $9.8 to $10.6. In this zone, it has resistance from the 20-day EMA, the 50-day SMA and the downtrend line.  The EOS/USD pair will change its trend once it breaks out of the downtrend line. Until then, we are unable to recommend any reliable trades in it.

2018-02-15 14:55:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Western Union Confirms Testing Ripple Technology For Money Transfers,"Cointelegraph Western Union has confirmed testing transactions based on Ripple’s Blockchain to provide faster and cheaper domestic and cross-border transfers. News The financial services provider Western Union (WU) is testing transactions with the use of Ripple’s (XRP) Blockchain-based settlement system, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal said in an interview with Bloomberg Feb. 14. The globally known money transfer company Western Union confirmed that it is testing Ripple following more than a month of rumor-fuelled speculation that began in early January. The announcement comes after Western Union reported its 2017 results, claiming a revenue of $1.4 bln - a 5 percent increase over the previous year. As Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Bloomberg, WU has decided to look into their platform in order to facilitate money transfers, particularly cross-border ones. Garlinghouse explained their choice by claiming that Ripple allows for transactions that are “a thousand times faster and a thousand times cheaper than Bitcoin’s.” According to Bloomberg, Western Union’s Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek also confirmed that testing is taking place during a conference call Tuesday, Feb. 13. “We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,” Ersek said, adding “we do have some tests with Ripple.” Ripple (XRP) is a Blockchain-based settlement protocol and a cryptocurrency that has reached almost half of Bitcoin’s market capitalization in early January 2018, when its price rallied to over $3.00 per coin. By the middle of January, however, the XRP price has bounced back to a little over $1.00. Wednesday, Feb. 14, Cointelegraph reported on a partnership signed between Ripple and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to provide the technology for cross-border payments to banks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

2017-10-02 19:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 2","Cointelegraph Japan and Singapore are taking over Chinese traders. What will happen to the prices? See to find out. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The Chinese traders don’t want to miss the action in trading cryptocurrencies. Therefore, they are moving over to Hong Kong as the Chinese exchanges shut down. Elsewhere, Japan, South Korea and the US are moving ahead with steps that will promote the digital currency markets. As a result of these positive steps, the virtual currencies continue their march higher. So, has the pullback run its course or is there more steam left? Let’s see. Traders who followed our previous recommendations would have entered long positions around $3,900 and $4,120, levels marked on the chart via ellipse. Though both the positions are in profit and our target objective is $4,680, we recommend selling about 30 percent of the position at the current levels of $4,418 and raising the stop loss on the rest to $4,000.  That way, our entire remaining position will become risk-free and we will also pocket some profit. Our first target objective is $4,680, where we shall book profits on another 20 percent of the position because we expect some resistance to creep in. If Bitcoin breaks out of the $4,680 levels, it is likely to retest the highs, where we plan to book profits on the remaining 50 percent of our original position. On a fall, the digital currency will find support in the $4,000 to $4,165 zone. Once $4,000 level breaks, the virtual currency can extend its fall to $3,850 and thereafter to $3,600 levels. We don’t have any live trades in Ethereum. The digital currency has been consolidating in a tight range of about $280 to $310 for the past seven days. This tight range will soon resolve itself either to the upside or downside.  If the cryptocurrency breaks out of $317 levels, it will gain momentum and quickly rally to $344, where we expect some resistance to creep in. If this level is crossed, then a move to $400 to $420 levels is likely. Therefore, we recommend buying at $317. However, if Ethereum breaks down of the uptrend line, it will invalidate the bullish pattern and a move to lower levels of $255 is likely. Therefore, we want to keep a stop loss just below the trendline at $275 once our buy levels are triggered. We recommend tightening the stop loss if the virtual currency struggles to breakout of $344 levels. The level of interest in Bitcoin Cash has dwindled down, which has resulted in a range bound action in the last few days. The cryptocurrency is even finding it difficult to rally to the highs of the range.  For the past few days it has remained in the lower half of the range. Therefore, we don’t recommend any trading positions in Bitcoin Cash. We shall resume trading in Bitcoin Cash if it breaks out of the range or if it strengthens the range with two touches on the upper end of the range and two bounces off the lower end of the range. Ripple is testing our patience, as it has been range bound for the past five days. Our long positions are at a marginal loss. We want to raise our stop loss to $0.18500 levels because if the digital currency breaks down of the small uptrend line, it can correct to $0.16600 levels.  The cryptocurrency will gain strength above $0.22000 levels. Our target objective remains $0.25000. We don’t see any pattern developing on ripple. Therefore, lackluster trading is likely to continue for a few more days. We don’t have any trades on Litecoin because it never reached our buy levels of $58.  The digital currency did not breakout of the ascending triangle. The pattern is now invalid as the price has broken down of the uptrend line. Litecoin is likely to remain in the range of $44 and $57. We have two trade recommendations on Litecoin. First is a buy at $58 with a stop loss of $50, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the range. However, if Litecoin falls to the lower end of range before breaking out of it, we shall buy around $44 and keep an SL of $40. For this trade, our target objective is $57.

2017-09-29 21:24:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 29","Cointelegraph Latest trading review on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Japan is unperturbed with its neighbor’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies. While Chinese exchanges are stopping trading from this month’s end, Japan has granted 11 cryptocurrency exchange licenses. In the US, Keith Noreika, acting comptroller of the currency for the U.S. Treasury Department has said that Bitcoin companies might be granted “fintech charters” in the future. He also said that he was open to the idea of the banks conducting their business in cryptocurrencies. This shows that while one nation is closing its doors to cryptocurrencies, others are warming up to it. Let’s see if this news can boost cryptocurrencies higher. Though Bitcoin triggered our buy at $4120 levels, it could not sustain the rally and plunged to $4018.32. Nevertheless, lower levels attracted buying, again bringing Bitcoin to the verge of breaking out of the ascending triangle pattern, which is a bullish development.  The minimum target objective of a breakout from the triangle is $5358, however, we shall go one step at a time. On a breakout above $4280, the currency is likely to rally to $4680, where we recommend selling half of one’s position. The other half can be held with a close stop, because above $4680 the digital currency can quickly rally to $5000 levels. Traders who are long on our previous recommendations should keep a stop loss of $3750. They can tighten their stops further to $4000 once the digital currency rallies above $4280. We shall keep trailing the stops higher as the market moves in our favor. Ethereum did not trigger our buy levels, because we had recommended a long position only if the digital currency closed above $312 and the highest closing in the last three days was $309.61.  Once it was clear that Ethereum wouldn’t breakout, sellers emerged. As a result, Ethereum plunged to $278.88, close to the trendline. If the digital currency breaks below the trendline, it is likely to fall to $255 and to $235 levels. Therefore, we want to initiate a long position only on a confirmation of a resumption of the uptrend. We now recommend a long position at $317. Traders should keep their stop loss at $270 and the target objective is $420. However, there is significant resistance at $344. Therefore, traders should tighten their stop loss if the digital currency struggles to breakout of this resistance. Bitcoin Cash is range bound between $385 and $549. Within this range, the cryptocurrency is likely to remain volatile. Therefore, we shall buy it only after it breaks out of the range. Until then, we will stick to the other cryptocurrencies that are trending.  However, for traders who want to trade Bitcoin Cash only, they can buy once the digital currency bounces from the lower end of the range at $385. Profits should be booked at the upper end of the range at $549. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $350 because if the digital currency breaks down of this level, it can sink to $300. Ripple could not continue higher after breaking out of the resistance at $0.19537. It fell to $0.18800 levels where buying emerged.  As a result, the digital currency has again broken out of $0.19537. We expect the currency to gain momentum once it breaks out of $0.22000 levels. Traders who are long on our previous recommendation should maintain their stop loss at $0.16500. They should raise the stops to $0.18500 once Ripple breaks out of $0.22000. The target objective is $0.25000. Litecoin did not reach our buy levels, therefore, no trade was triggered. The cryptocurrency fell close to $50 levels where it found buying support.  If Litecoin breaks above $58, it is likely to start a new uptrend which could carry it to $72 levels. Therefore, traders can buy at $58 and keep a stop loss at $44. Once the currency breaks out of $64 the stop loss can be increased to $50.   *This article was written Sept 29, 7 p.m. UTC Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-09-27 19:35:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 27","Cointelegraph Latest trading review on most popular cryptocurrencies Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Mike Novogratz, the ex-macro manager at Fortress Investment Group believes there is a huge opportunity in cryptocurrencies. He reportedly plans to launch a $500 mln hedge fund, investing $150 mln of his own money into the fund, which is likely to start by the end of this year. He said that he sold his Bitcoins around $4,980 and again bought closer to $3,000 levels. But, what should we do? Let’s see. After breaking out of the downtrend line, Bitcoin consolidated in a small range Sept. 26. However, today, Sept. 27, it has resumed its upmove. $4,113.15 is the final resistance, above which, the digital currency will resume a new uptrend, which can carry it to $4,680 levels. There is a small resistance at $4,380; however, we expect it to be crossed easily. Aggressive traders who initiated long on our previous recommendation should maintain their stop loss at $3,500. New positions can be added once the digital currency breaks out and closes above $4,120. The downtrend line should offer support on any fall. Therefore, once Bitcoin breaks out of $4,120, stops can be raised to $3,750. Traders should use less than 50 percent of their usual position size. We expect bears to offer a stiff resistance at higher levels. Ethereum continues to trade within the ascending triangle, which will complete on a breakout of $311. This bullish setup has a target objective of $420. The pattern will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down of the uptrend line. The breakdown can sink Ethereum to $240 levels. Within the triangle, the cryptocurrency is likely to be volatile. Therefore, we recommend a long position only on a breakout and close above $312. The SL can be kept just below the uptrend line at $260. Though the pattern target is $420, Ethereum may face selling pressure at $344. Therefore, traders should tighten their stop loss if the digital currency struggles to breakout of $344.   Bitcoin Cash is not showing any trend. It is likely to be range-bound between $385 and $549. It will become bullish only when it sustains above the $549 levels. Therefore, we prefer to trade other cryptocurrencies, which are forming a bullish setup.   Nevertheless, traders who want to trade Bitcoin Cash can buy at the lower end of the range at $385 with a stop loss of $350. They should book profits at the upper end of the range at $549. A fall and close below $385 can sink Bitcoin Cash to $300 levels. Ripple has broken out of the overhead resistance of $0.19537. It should now rally to $0.25000 levels. Therefore, traders can enter long positions at the current levels and on any dips towards $0.20000 levels and keep a stop loss of $0.16500. However, this is a high-risk trade because Ripple is not in an uptrend. It is forming a large bearish descending triangle pattern. Therefore, please keep the position size 50 percent of normal. After the sharp fall, Litecoin has become range bound between $44 and $57.729. If the digital currency breaks out of this range, it will start a new uptrend, which has a minimum pattern target of $72. The traders can buy on a breakout and close above $58. The initial stop loss can be kept at $44, which can be raised once the cryptocurrency moves higher. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout of $58, it is likely to remain volatile within the range. Therefore, please buy only on a breakout.

2017-09-25 15:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 25","Cointelegraph Latest price overview and trading suggestions. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. China has banned ICOs and has ended cryptocurrency trading opportunities on the Chinese exchanges. However, it is moving ahead with steps to study the Blockchain technology in detail to issue its own digital currency. Beijing should “accelerate the process of launching a sovereign digital currency after it curbed risks of cryptocurrencies,” said an opinion piece published in the Financial News, the mouthpiece of the People’s Bank of China(PBOC). However, with credit rating agencies recently downgrading China’s sovereign rating, it is unlikely that a digital currency issued by the PBOC will displace Bitcoin or Ethereum. Bitcoin has been trading in a small range for the past two days. It is facing resistance at the 3,800 levels. Today, even if the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line, it is unlikely to race away towards the highs. It will face resistance from the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $3,886.  Thereafter, the next resistance zone is between $4,050 and $4,120 levels. Unless Bitcoin breaks out of this, it is likely to remain range-bound and volatile. Nevertheless, a breakout of the downtrend line will change the trend from down to range bound. On the downside, the digital currency has a strong support at $3,500 levels. A breakdown of this level can push the cryptocurrency back towards the lows of $2,974. Currently, we don’t find a buy setup with a good risk to reward ratio. Nevertheless, aggressive traders can look for buying opportunities once Bitcoin breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. The initial stop loss can be kept at 3,500, which can be raised later. The position size shouldn’t be more than 25 percent of the normal. If Bitcoin gains momentum, additional positions can be added above $4,120 levels. The first target objective on the upside is $4,680, above which a retest of the lifetime highs is likely. Ethereum is attempting to move higher. It has broken out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. It has also formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $311. The pattern target on a breakout of the triangle is $420.  However, the digital currency will have to sustain above the uptrend line to keep the formation intact. If Ethereum breaks below the uptrend line, it will invalidate the pattern, sinking the digital currency to $235 levels. We don’t find any trade as long as the cryptocurrency trades inside the triangle. We recommend a long position on a breakout and close above $312, SL $260 and target $420. Traders should enter long positions only on a confirmed close above the overhead resistance. $344 might act as a resistance; however, we expect this level to be crossed. Bitcoin Cash firmly remains below the downtrend line. It hasn’t done much in the past four days. $400 has acted as a strong support, however, lack of buying at higher levels has resulted in small range days.  As Bitcoin Cash is not showing any trend, we don’t have a recommendation on it. We shall consider it only after it sustains above the downtrend line for three days or breaks out of $550. Ripple is not showing any trend. It is stuck in a tight range between $0.15000 and $0.19300. We don’t find any trade within this range.  If ripple breaks out of $0.20000, aggressive traders can initiate long positions with a target objective of $0.25000. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $0.15000. Nevertheless, please don’t allocate more than 25 percent of the usual position size on this trade, because it is a low conviction setup. On the lower side, $0.15000 and $0.13500 are the two critical supports to watch out for. Litecoin has held the critical support of $45. However, it is struggling to move higher.  It is likely to break out of the downtrend line. However, it will not become positive until it breaks out of the $60 levels. It is likely to remain range-bound between $45 and $57 for the next few days. Therefore, we are not recommending a trade on it. Critical levels to watch out are $60 on the upside and $45 on the downside. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

Bitcoin has entered a bear market and most of the news around it has turned bearish. Experts are speculating about the future of cryptocurrencies and what can be done to reduce the volatility.

There have been many such corrections in Bitcoin’s journey to $5,000 and investors who had the stomach to sit through it have been rewarded handsomely. Nevertheless, it’s difficult for many to digest this volatility and they prefer to trade the short-term swings. For such traders, we provide critical levels that can be kept in mind while initiating a trade. Let’s see the latest recommendations. After the sharp fall, Bitcoin’s recovery hit a roadblock around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $4,975 to $2,974. Additionally, the downtrend line has offered resistance twice. Therefore, it also becomes a strong resistance point. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) are also on the verge of a bearish crossover. All these indicate that Bitcoin is in a downtrend. So, how far can the cryptocurrency fall? Bitcoin has a strong support at $3,500 levels, from where it has risen on Sept. 16 and 17. If this level breaks, then the final support is at $3,409, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the pullback from $2,974 to $4,113.15. Below this level, the digital currency is likely to retest the lows at $2,974. Bitcoin is volatile. It turns around in a jiffy. What are the levels to watch out for if it turns around? The first bullish sign is a breakout and closes above the downtrend line. This is where the aggressive traders should initiate long positions. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please keep the allocation size small. Long positions can be added once Bitcoin breaks out and closes above $4,113.15. Traders should refrain from buying on dips because a breakdown below $2,974 will be very bearish. We had predicted Ethereum to fall to $240 in our previous analysis, which has materialized. What next? If the digital currency breaks below $240, it is likely to fall to $223 levels, which is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $200.15 to $310.7. If this level also breaks, then the digital currency will retest the lows at $200. First signs of a recovery will be when the digital currency breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. Nevertheless, the rally is likely to face resistance from the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Ethereum is likely to gain strength only above $312 levels. Therefore, traders should wait for a breakout above $312 to initiate any long positions. We were correct in predicting a fall to $400 levels on Bitcoin Cash if it failed to breakout of the downtrend line. Now, if it breaks below the $400 support, it can fall to $357 and thereafter to $300 levels. Bitcoin Cash is in a strong downtrend since topping out at $972 on Aug. 19. Therefore, even if it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line, we advise against initiating long positions until the digital currency breaks out of $550. Ripple is likely to retest the lows at $0.15000 once again. Any recovery is likely to face resistance at the $0.19300 and the $0.20000 levels. We don’t see any buy setups even if the digital currency breaks out of $0.20000 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on ripple until we see a clear trend. Litecoin is in a strong downtrend. If it doesn’t find support at $45, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the pullback from $32.681 to $57.729, it is likely to fall to $42 and after that to $38 levels. Litecoin will not be out of the woods until it breaks out and sustains above $60 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it.

2017-09-20 15:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 20","Cointelegraph Latest trading review on top 5 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The rebound in the cryptocurrencies has hit a wall following a slew of negative headlines. Today, we should get some insight into the Fed’s plans to shrink its massive balance sheet. This news will affect the US dollar and can also influence the cryptocurrencies. These are uncertain times; therefore, we suggest traders cut their position size in half to limit their risk. Bitcoin has been facing resistance at the $4,100 levels, according to our expectation.  Between $4,000 and $4,100, there is a confluence of resistance from both the moving averages and the downtrend line. The 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $4,975 to $2,974 is also just below the $4,000 levels. Therefore, we had avoided recommending any trade in our previous analysis. However, after consolidating for three days, if Bitcoin breaks out of this resistance zone, we expect it to gain momentum on the upside. Though there is a minor resistance at $4,210 - the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level - we expect this resistance to be crossed. The next major resistance is at $4,680, after which a retest of the highs is likely. Therefore, we recommend buying Bitcoin on a breakout above $4,120. However, before initiating long positions, the traders should watch for an hour or two to confirm that the breakout is sustaining. The stop loss can be maintained at $3,660 initially. Once the cryptocurrency breaks out of $4,210, the stops can be raised to $3,800. Traders should similarly trail their stops higher to reduce their risk. Partial profits can be booked at $4,600 levels. Remaining positions can be sold closer to $5,000 levels. On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to breakout of the overhead resistance, it will retrace the recent bounce from the lows and is likely to fall to $3,500 levels. Ethereum also performed according to our expectations. It is facing stiff resistance from both the moving averages and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $409.42 to $200.15.  A breakout of the resistance zone of $275 to $310 will indicate strength. Therefore, traders can buy above $312 and keep a stop loss of $250. There is a minor resistance zone between $329 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level) and $344. If the digital currency struggles to breakout of these levels, traders should raise their stops to breakeven. However, if these levels are crossed, a move to $409 is likely. On the other hand, if the digital currency is unable to breakout of the overhead resistance, it can fall to $240 levels, which is a significant support. Bitcoin Cash has been hovering around the $500 mark for the past two days.  It has been facing resistance from the downtrend line. However, a breakout and close above the downtrend line can propel the digital currency towards the $700 levels. Therefore, the traders can initiate long positions at $550 and keep a stop loss at $400. If, however, the cryptocurrency returns from the downtrend line, it can fall to $400 levels.   Ripple has not been able to breakout of the critical overhead resistance of $0.19300.  The digital currency remains bearish until it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle. It has support at $0.15000 and $0.13500 levels. Notwithstanding, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of the downtrend line, it will indicate a change in trend. Failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. However, we don’t find any buy setups. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on Ripple. Litecoin is facing resistance at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $93.649 to $32.681.  The cryptocurrency will change its trend only on a breakout above the downtrend line and the overhead resistance at $60. Until the digital currency trades below these levels, it remains weak. We don’t find any reliable buy setups on Litecoin thus we remain neutral on it. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2017-09-18 14:15:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 18","Cointelegraph Analytical review on top 5 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by HitBTC exchange. Last week, cryptocurrencies plunged following news of the Chinese crackdown. Though the fall was sharp, it was short lived. Lower levels gave an opportunity to the eager bulls to make an entry. So, has the correction ended and will digital currencies again resume their gravity-defying run? Should you jump in right away or will the cryptocurrencies retest last week’s lows? Let’s look at the charts and find out. We expected Bitcoin to pullback to about $3200 levels, but it never dipped below $3500.05. This shows that there is enough buying support at lower levels.  Nevertheless, after the pullback of the past four days, the digital currency has reached the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $4975 to $2974, which should act as a resistance. Additionally, Bitcoin is likely to face resistance between the $3955 and $4100 levels, from both the moving averages and the downtrend line. We don’t expect the digital currency to climb back to its lifetime highs in a hurry. We expect some kind of a consolidation or a minor pullback towards the recent lows once again. However, if the price continues to rally and breaks out of both the moving averages and the downtrend line, we will throw in the towel and quit looking for a pullback. Ethereum never pulled back to our buy levels of $220. The lowest it fell to was $238.98 levels yesterday. The digital currency has broken out of the descending channel, which is a positive sign.  Currently, Ethereum has reached close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $409.42 to $200.15, which should offer stiff resistance. Additionally, we expect the digital currency to face resistance from both of the moving averages. However, if the next pullback doesn’t fall below $250 levels, it will indicate significant strength and we shall look for buying opportunities. However, we don’t find any attractive buy setups at the current levels. Bitcoin Cash has bounced a whopping 64 percent from its lows. Currently, it is likely to face resistance from the 50-period simple moving average (SMA), and the psychological barrier of $500. Above the moving average, the cryptocurrency can rally to the downtrend line at about $580 levels.  On the other hand, if the digital currency is unable to breakout above $500, it can fall to $400 levels. As we don’t find any attractive setups, we are not recommending a trade on it.   Ripple has pulled back close to $0.19300, where it has a confluence of resistances from the moving averages and the downtrend line.  We shall change our view only after a breakout and close above the downtrend line of the descending triangle. Until then, we remain neutral on Ripple. Even after the pullback from the lows, Litecoin is currently trading below both the moving averages and the downtrend line. It has a number of resistances between the $56 and $68 levels.  Therefore, we believe that the risk to reward ratio is not favorable to enter long positions now. We shall wait for a suitable set up to form before recommending any trade. Note from the author:Though all the top five cryptocurrencies have rebounded sharply from their lows, we expect some kind of a consolidation or correction within the next few days. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade today as buying at the current levels is risky. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2017-09-15 18:15:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 15","Cointelegraph Has the market ever been so volatile before? Don’t miss the latest analytical overview on prices. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. BTC China has decided to shut down operations by Sept. 30. The first reaction by harried traders on such announcements is to sell and encash their holdings. Therefore, the sharp fall is understandable. Does this mean that traders around the world should also panic? No, because after the initial selling subsides, aggressive bulls will start buying at important support levels. Should we also join the early buyers or should we wait for more confirmation before initiating long positions? Let’s see. Bitcoin has completed a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $1,752 to $4,975. Aggressive buyers have taken advantage of the sharp fall and have initiated long positions close to $2,970 levels, which is a crucial support.  Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will quickly rally $5,000 levels because the bears will again short at higher levels. We expect selling pressure at the $3,800 levels, closer to the downtrend line. Therefore, we recommend waiting for another successful retest of $2,970 before initiating long positions. However, aggressive traders can buy 25 percent of their allocation on dips to about $3,200 levels. The stop loss should be placed at $2,900 and the profit objective is $3,800. The digital currency is likely to remain volatile for the next few days. Therefore, traders should play for small profits.   Ethereum broke below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $129.78 to $409.42. However, strong buying support emerged closer to the $200 levels, pushing prices higher.  Nevertheless, the digital currency is trading inside a descending channel. We expect bears to sell closer to $270 levels. Therefore, we recommend waiting for a successful retest of $200 levels before buying. First signs of a bottom will form when the digital currency breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. Aggressive traders can buy closer to $220 and keep a stop loss of $190. Profits should be booked closer to $270 levels. Bitcoin Cash completed a 100 percent retracement of the rally from $296.38 to $972. $300 is a strong support, which has held for now. However, we expect selling close to the downtrend line.  Any long position should be initiated only after a successful retest of $300 levels. We prefer to buy the leaders because they are likely rebound more than Bitcoin Cash.   We were short on ripple and our first target objective of $0.15000 was met. Hopefully, traders would have booked their profits.  The digital currency is currently in a pullback, which is likely to face resistance at the $0.19300 levels. If the overhead resistance holds, the cryptocurrency is likely to turn down towards $0.15000 levels once again. However, if price breaks out of the overhead resistance, it can rally to the downtrend line. We shall look for buying opportunities only after ripple breaks out of the downtrend line and $0.19300 levels. Litecoin had broken below the descending triangle pattern, which had a target of $30. Today, the digital currency came close to its target and reversed from there. Currently, it has risen about $20 from its intraday lows of the day, which shows the kind of huge volatility in it. Nevertheless, any pullback is likely to face resistance at the $60 levels. Therefore, we shall wait for lower levels before initiating any long positions. All the top five cryptocurrencies have become very volatile. Therefore, traders should reduce their allocation size by at least 50 percent to safeguard their capital. *Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin charts are provided by HitBTC exchange.

2017-09-13 13:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 13","Cointelegraph Daily analytical price overview. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Back in 2015, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had said that people trading in digital currencies such as Bitcoin were wasting their time. Notwithstanding, the lucky few who wasted their time back then would be sitting on more than 900 percent returns. What a fantastic way to waste time. Fast forward two years and Dimon has intensified his criticism of Bitcoin, calling it “a fraud” and a bubble “worse than tulip bulbs”. Nevertheless, he doesn’t want to short Bitcoin either, because he is not sure how far the bubble will expand. Let’s study the charts and try to forecast whether we should buy this correction or stay out of it. Bitcoin has extended its correction and is currently at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a crucial support. A break and close below this level is likely to exacerbate selling, which can sink the digital currency to $3363, which is a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $1752 to $4975.  However, the RSI will enter oversold territory if Bitcoin falls sharply below the 50-day SMA. Three previous oversold readings on the RSI have proven to be an excellent buying opportunity. Hence, it can be risky to short bitcoin at the current levels. On the other hand, if Bitcoin bounces from the 50-day SMA, it will face resistance at the downtrend line. We shall turn bullish only after Bitcoin stops falling and breaks out of the downtrend line. At current levels, we should remain neutral on the cryptocurrency, as we don’t find any good setups, either to go long or short. We were correct in avoiding a trade on Ethereum in our previous analysis. A short trade would have hit our stop loss above $310 and a long trade would also have hit the stop loss.  So, what next? Ethereum is comparatively weaker than Bitcoin, as it has already broken below the 50-day SMA. It is currently at a critical 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $129.78 to $409.42. A break below this crucial support can sink the digital currency to $236 levels, which is a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the upmove. However, we don’t find an attractive short trade setup, which has a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we remain neutral on Ethereum. Bitcoin Cash has broken down below the range of $523 to $736. Its next support is at $470 from where it had bounced on Sept. 5. If this level breaks, the cryptocurrency may plummet to $440.  On the other hand, if the digital currency finds support at $470, it is again likely to enter into the range. We don’t find any attractive long or short trading setups, therefore, we remain neutral on Bitcoin Cash. Ripple could not breakout of the downtrend line and rally above $0.23500, therefore, our long trade was not triggered.  The digital currency is perilously close to breaking down below $0.19300 levels that will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, which has a lower pattern target of $0.085. However, we expect $0.13500 to act as a strong support because this level has not been broken down on a closing basis since early-May of this year. We recommend a short trade on ripple on a close below $0.19000 with a stop loss of $0.22500. Please cover 50 percent of the shorts closer to $0.15000 levels, and trail the remaining position with a close stop loss.  Litecoin has broken down the descending triangle pattern. It can fall to $52 and thereafter to $41 levels. Again, a stop loss and the target objective don’t justify a short trade. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it. *Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin charts are provided by HitBTC exchange.

2017-10-04 18:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 04","Cointelegraph Latest trading review on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein indirectly hinted that cryptocurrencies are on their way to replacing paper money. This is in stark contrast to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has still not acknowledged the rise and acceptance of cryptocurrencies across the globe. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that at least a few major investment banks are pondering over allowing investors direct trading opportunities in cryptocurrencies. Experts are bullish on Bitcoin, expecting it to reach $6,000 by the end of this year. That is a good 42 percent above the current price of $4,200. Let’s see, whether this is a good time to enter cryptocurrencies or are they due to fall further. We had recommended taking 30 percent profits on our Bitcoin positions at $4,418. That made our existing investment in Bitcoin risk-free. So, should traders re-enter at the current levels or will Bitcoin fall further? There is a confluence of support between $4,114 to $4,170, from the 20-day exponential moving average, the 50-day simple moving average, the horizontal line, and the trendline. Therefore, we expect this support to hold, at least in the short-term. The subsequent rise from here will decide whether Bitcoin will resume its uptrend and rally above $4,500 or will it turn down and sink below $4,000. Aggressive traders, who trade for the short-term, can buy at the current levels of around $4,218 and keep a stop loss of $4,000. The target objective is $4488. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please keep the allocation size 25 percent of normal. For swing traders, please maintain the stop loss at $4,000 and don’t add any fresh positions. If Bitcoin breaks down and closes well below the trendline, it is likely to fall to $3,900 and $3,731 levels, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the pullback from $2,974 to $4,488.01. Ethereum could not breakout of the bullish ascending triangle pattern and price has moved out of the trendline, invalidating the setup. The cryptocurrency is consolidating between the $278.88 and $316.61 levels for the past few days. Both the moving averages have also flattened out, signaling a range bound action. Ethereum doesn’t have a history of forming large ranges. Therefore, we expect a breakout or breakdown of this range soon. We recommend waiting for a breakout above $317 to enter long positions. Though there is a resistance at $344, we expect the digital currency to breakout of it and rally to $354. The stop loss for this trade should be kept at $278. However, if Ethereum breaks down of $280, it is likely to extend its fall to $257.94, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $200.15 to $315.72. We have been cautious on Bitcoin Cash for the past few days and the price action has validated our stance. Should you buy this fall? In our previous analysis, we did not recommend any trade on bitcoin cash because we were not confident that the range will hold. Today, the digital currency has broken down of the range, which gives it a lower target of $221, unless Bitcoin Cash quickly reverses direction and ends the day above $385. Though we expect some buying to emerge at $300 levels, we are not recommending any trades on Bitcoin Cash. We shall wait for a bottom formation before buying it. We have carried a long position in Ripple from the past week. Ripple is sustaining above both the moving averages and the trendline support, which is a positive sign.  The digital currency will gain momentum once it breaks out of $0.22000 levels. Our target level remains at $0.25000. Traders should maintain the stop loss at $0.185000. The cryptocurrency will become negative if it breaks down and closes below the uptrend line. Until then, we remain bullish on Ripple. We have been waiting for a breakout of the range in Litecoin, which has not happened. So, should you buy at the lower end of the range? Litecoin is trading within a well-defined range of $44.160 on the lower end and $57.729 on the upper end. As the cryptocurrency was unable to breakout of the range, it is likely to fall to the lower end of the range, if it breaks down of $50. We expect the range to hold; therefore, we recommend a long position in Litecoin around $46 levels when price turns up after touching the lower end of the range at $44. Please don’t buy when the digital currency is falling. We can keep a stop loss of $40 and our target objective will be a rally to $57. On the other hand, if Litecoin holds the $50 levels and rallies above $58 levels, we expect it to start a new uptrend. Therefore, we recommend long positions at $58 with a stop loss of $49. Our target objective is $71. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us! We will reply to you as soon as possible.

2017-10-05 14:15:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple CEO Takes Swipe at Science Experiment ‘Blockchain Tourists’,"Cointelegraph Ripple’s CEO believes that too many companies are treating Blockchain tech like a science experiment. Adoption Chief executive of cryptocurrency start-up Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, has spoken out at the number of companies and people using Blockchain technology more as a buzzword, rather than creating real world use cases. The boom of ICOs has seen hundreds of new companies try and build a business on Blockchain technology, but according to Garlinghouse, many of them could be better served simply using databases. ""Blockchain is like the new big data or AI (artificial intelligence) — too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem,"" Garlinghouse said. ""We like to call them Blockchain tourists! There are many applications that are nothing more than science experiments."" Of course, Blockchain technology is the same technology that Ripple is pinned to, or for that matter, any cryptocurrency. However, Ripple can claim it has real world application, as there has been an exploration into the banking sector as Ripple focuses on banks, global payments, and digital exchange. ""Some of the uses being implemented for Blockchain could actually work better with a database,"" he added. ""There are examples out there that Blockchain is not most applicable for, and that is why Ripple is focused on a real world use case, solving a real (and very large) customer problem, which has converted into commercial traction that is unmatched in the enterprise Blockchain space."" There are a ton of start up style companies that have hopped on the bandwagon of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology, and tokenization. A lot of these have merit, but there are also many that are not worth the white paper they are written on. The boom of ICO has irked many regulators, with the likes of China taking the hardest approach to them, with Korea, and even the SEC in the USA following similar suit. However, there are some large and established traditional firms that are taking the power of the Blockchain forward leaps and bounds, as they utilize the powerful technology to alleviate problems. IBM for example has not only built a Blockchain for major global banks such as Deutsche Bank and HSBC; it also developed a Blockchain-based solution for the food ecosystem that allows producers to trace food contamination in a matter of seconds. Accounting giant EY also unveiled its own distributed ledger solution for the shipping insurance industry last month. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

Similar to all markets, even in cryptocurrencies, traders continue shifting their loyalties from Bitcoin to altcoins, which results in one outperforming the other. While comparing the performance of  the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the third quarter of this year, Bitcoin has emerged as the leader, gaining 74%. Bitcoin Cash was not considered, as it did not trade for the full quarter. The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum, turned out a weak performance, rising only 8% in the third quarter. This is in stark contrast to its staggering rally of 500% in the second quarter of this year. This shows that traders will make money only if they are invested in the right cryptocurrency. Let’s find the most promising one to trade now. We have carried long positions in Bitcoin for both the swing traders and the aggressive traders. Both these positions are currently in a profit. What should the traders do now?  Bitcoin has risen from the critical support levels of $4114 to $4170, according to our expectations. If the digital currency breaks out of $4488, it is likely to rally to $4680 levels. This is the last resistance before a retest of the highs at $5000. Therefore, swing traders should continue to hold their positions, but they should raise their stop loss from $4000 to $4100. They should tighten their stops further once the digital currency breaks out of $4488. The aggressive traders should book 30% of their profits at the current levels of $4387 and hold the rest with a stop loss of $4100. This will reduce their risk on the existing positions. Once Bitcoin rallies above $4488, they should again raise their stop loss to breakeven and book partial profits at $4680. Our bullish view on bitcoin will be invalidated if it turns down and breaks below $4100 levels. That can extend the fall to $3909 and $3731 levels, which are 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the pullback from $2974 to $4488.01. Ethereum has spent the past few days consolidating in a tight range. This shows an equilibrium between both the bulls and the bears. Neither party is able to overpower the other. However, this is unlikely to continue for long. One of the two will emerge as a winner.  If Ethereum breaks out of the upper end of the range at $317, it is likely to start a new uptrend, which has a pattern target of $354. Therefore, we recommend a long position on the digital currency at $317. The initial stop loss can be kept at $278, which should be raised as the cryptocurrency moves higher. The stops should be tightened further if Ethereum struggles to breakout of the overhead resistance at $344. If, however, the bears manage to push Ethereum below $278, it will open up a downside of $257.94, which is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $200.15 to $315.72. Bitcoin Cash is attempting to stabilize after breaking down of the range. However, compared to the other cryptocurrencies, it still lacks buying interest.  We have been cautious on Bitcoin Cash for the past few days. The digital currency continues to trade below both the critical moving averages and the downtrend line. This shows that it remains in a downtrend. Therefore, we don’t recommend a long trade on Bitcoin Cash. The first target on the downside is $300 if Bitcoin Cash is unable to climb above $385. On the other hand, if the cryptocurrency rallies above the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, it will signal strength. Traders who trade only Bitcoin Cash can buy at $436 and keep a stop loss of $336. The profit objective is $549. Rest of the traders are better off trading other cryptocurrencies. Our long position in Ripple continues to make gains. It is close to our target objective of $0.25000. Should traders book profits?  The downtrend line at $0.25000 is likely to offer a strong resistance. However, if the digital currency breaks out of it, a rally to $0.3000o is possible. Therefore, traders can book partial profits, about 30% at the current levels and raise the stops on the remaining position to breakeven. This will ensure that the traders pocket some profits and the remaining position becomes risk-free. They should continue to trail their stops higher if the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line. Currently, Litecoin is trading at the center of the range between $44.16 and $57.729. How can we trade it?  The best way to trade in a range is to buy at the support and sell at the resistance. However, as price is ruling at the midpoint, we don’t recommend a trade at the current levels. Nevertheless, if Litecoin breaks out of the range, it will signal strength. Therefore, we recommend a long position at $58 with a stop loss of $49. The target objective of this trade is $71. However, if the digital currency breaks below $50 and falls to $44 levels, we shall wait and watch its performance at the lows before buying it. We don’t recommend a long position at $44 anymore because of the lack of buying interest in the digital currency. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-10-09 18:30:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 09","Cointelegraph Bitcoin has once again proved to be the dominant cryptocurrency. What does it mean for altcoins? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The top two currencies by market capitalization are nearing critical updates and the market is clearly favoring one over the other. Over the weekend, traders sold the altcoins and piled on Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoin’s dominance has again crossed over the halfway mark. Will this trend continue or will the altcoins play catch up? Let’s find out. Our readers continue to benefit from the rally in Bitcoin. The upmove over the weekend has carried the cryptocurrency towards our target objective. So, should we sell out or wait?  The digital currency has reached $4680 levels, which is a major resistance. We expect a small pullback or a consolidation at these levels. Therefore, we recommend selling around 50% of the existing positions at the current levels and holding the rest with a stop loss of $4250. We don’t want to book out of our complete position because the uptrend in Bitcoin is still strong. A breakout above $4680 will push the virtual currency towards its all time highs. Therefore, we want to hold about 30 to 35% of our original position, expecting to book out around $5000. On the downside, Bitcoin has support from the trendline at $4400 levels. If this support breaks, the next major support zone is between $4150 and $4250 from both the moving averages. The outlook will become negative if it starts to trade below $4100 levels. Our long positions on Ethereum were initiated yesterday at $317. However, the position quickly turned into a loss as the cryptocurrency failed to sustain this level.  The bulls were unable to capitalize on the breakout of the range. As a result, the eager bulls, like us, are stuck with the long position. Both the moving averages are flat, suggesting continuation of the range bound action. Chances are that the cryptocurrency will now fall towards the lows of the range. Nevertheless, we shall continue to hold our position with a stop loss of $278. A breakdown and close below the range can sink Ethereum to $257 levels. The digital currency will become positive only on a breakout and close above $317. Bitcoin Cash has resumed its downtrend.  Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are moving in opposite directions. Bitcoin Cash has a major support at $300. We expect a small pullback or a consolidation close to this level. However, as the cryptocurrency is in a strong bear grip, we don’t recommend buying it. We shall consider buying the cryptocurrency only after it rallies and sustains above $385 levels. Until then, we shall stick to trading the other cryptocurrencies that have a bullish chart pattern. Our long positions continue to gain as Ripple rallies towards our second target objective of $0.30000. We had booked 30% profits in our long positions on Friday. What should we do with the remaining 70% position now?  With the breakout above the downtrend line, the cryptocurrency has invalidated the bearish descending triangle pattern, which is a bullish sign. A rally to $0.30000 is likely. Above $0.30000, the digital currency can rally to $032500 and $0.34000. Once these two levels are crossed, a move to $0.40000 is likely. However, considering the overhead resistances, we recommend booking profits on 50% of the existing long positions and holding the rest with a stop loss of $0.23500. We shall keep trailing this stop loss higher as the cryptocurrency moves up. On the downside, we expect a strong support at $0.25000 levels. A breakdown and close below this level will be negative for the cryptocurrency. Lackluster trading in Litecoin continues. The cryptocurrency is not showing any buying interest.  Over the weekend, Litecoin could not even cross the 20-day exponential moving average, which is a bearish sign. If the cryptocurrency breaks below $50, a fall to $44 is likely. As the digital currency has previously taken support at $44, we expect buyers to step in again this time. However, we shall wait for a confirmation before jumping in to buy at the lower end of the range. We are not recommending any trade on Litecoin until we get a breakout above $58.

2017-10-11 16:40:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 11","Cointelegraph Latest price review and trading suggestions on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The beauty of trading is that when prices are correcting, there’s news of doom all around. All the bears come out of hibernation, forecasting a crash, and the bulls hide in a corner. The exact opposite happens when price reaches lifetime highs. This creates fear in the minds of the traders who miss buying at the lows and selling at the highs. Therefore, we focus on the price action to forecast the next possible move. Now that Bitcoin is close to its highs, what should we do? Traders who went long at lower levels on our recommendations have been booking profits near resistances. We are left with about 30 - 35 percent of our original position, which we had planned to book at $5000. Should we book out close to the highs, or wait for higher levels?  Yesterday, the cryptocurrency reached a high of $4932.9, very close to our target levels. However, selling at the highs has pushed Bitcoin back below the $4800 levels. As the digital currency is trading above $4680, chances are that it will again attempt to breakout to new highs soon. If the bulls are successful in sustaining above $5000, the cryptocurrency is likely to gain momentum, and it will indicate the start of a new uptrend. Therefore, we recommend holding the existing position with a stop loss of $4500. We don’t want to keep a deeper stop loss because, usually, when bulls fail to breakout of a strong overhead resistance, bears sell aggressively, sending prices lower. So, if the bulls fail to breakout and sustain above $5000, we can expect the bears to push the cryptocurrency down to at least $4184.6 levels, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the pullback from $2974 to $4932.9. Traders who went long at $317 with a stop loss of $278 on our recommendation had to face a loss. In hindsight, it looks like we purchased at the highs of the range and sold off at the lows of the range.  However, we had intended to buy on a breakout of the range. As the range had been building for a few days, we believed that it would have enough force to carry it higher. Therefore, we didn’t recommend waiting for a close above the range to initiate long positions. Similarly, on the downside, we’d expected that once the cryptocurrency broke out, it wouldn’t return to the lows of the range. Nevertheless, Ethereum proved us wrong on both fronts. So, how can we trade Ethereum now? Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading close to the center of the range. We don’t want to enter a long trade unless Ethereum breaks out and closes above $317. We may miss out on a few points, but at least we won’t be caught in these fake breakouts and breakdowns. We shall keep an initial stop loss of $278 only, because, we don’t expect prices to fall back below the range, once it breaks out and closes above it. We have been correct in avoiding Bitcoin Cash on the long side. On Oct. 9, the cryptocurrency broke below the critical support of $300, forming a low of $280.1. So, is this low level a good time to buy?  Bitcoin Cash is devoid of buyers. Though the digital currency has recovered above $300 levels, it continues to make lower lows and lower highs, which suggests that a bottom is still not in place. Until the digital currency remains below $385 and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), it will continue to face selling pressure on rallies. On the lower end, Bitcoin Cash can fall to $285 and thereafter to $200 levels. On the upside, any rally towards $385 levels is likely to face stiff resistance. We don’t find any buy setup on the cryptocurrency; therefore, we don’t have any recommendation on it. The sharp fall on Oct. 9 hit our stop loss at $0.23500 on the 35 percent of our remaining position. This is the reason we always recommend booking partial profits as the price moves higher, especially when the cryptocurrency is not in a strong uptrend. Presently, we don’t have any positions in Ripple.  It has recovered after falling below the downtrend line on Oct. 9. However, bulls will face stiff resistance at $0.28000 and $0.30000. On the downside, the cryptocurrency has support at $0.23000. Considering the levels, we don’t find a trade set up with a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we shall wait and watch until we get a good entry point. There is nothing much happening in Litecoin. The cryptocurrency is stuck inside the range, due to which traders seem to have abandoned it at the moment.  Litecoin has a history of forming ranges and then breaking out of them. We’re currently in a similar situation. Whenever the price breaks out of the upper end of the range at $58, chances are that it will again take off. Until then, the cryptocurrency is likely to trade between $44 and $58. We shall not take a trade inside this range. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-10-13 14:05:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 13","Cointelegraph Bitcoin is breaking new highs. Find out what’s going with other cryptocurrencies and what trading moves to consider. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The traders continue to pile on Bitcoin, while altcoins languish. Bitcoin’s market dominance has crossed 55 percent, which shows that it’s now becoming a crowded trade. At times, it’s a good strategy to take the contrarian bet against the crowd. So, is it a good time to book profits on our Bitcoin positions and buy a few altcoins, or does Bitcoin have legs to further extend the rally? Let’s see. Leading up to its first fork in August, Bitcoin prices were in a corrective phase till about 15 days prior to the D-day. This time, however, prices have been in a consistent uptrend since bottoming out on Sept. 15.  After Bitcoin Cash was created, Bitcoin broke out and closed at new highs on Aug. 5, which started a strong uptrend that carried the cryptocurrency roughly 71 percent higher in just under a month. Will the same scenario be repeated this time? Looks unlikely. Last time, there were a number of folks who had sold off prior to the fork and were sitting on the sidelines. When Bitcoin did not crash, as a few had expected, all this money jumped back in, boosting prices within a short span of time. However, this time, people seem to be buying prior to the fork, so that they can benefit from the new coins. This is looking like a crowded trade. Can this get more crowded? Certainly. However, as we are sitting on decent profits on about 35 percent of our original position, we recommend booking out completely at current levels. Can prices rise further from here and make us look like fools? They certainly can. However, it can equally fall back below $5000 once this buying frenzy ends. It’s always better to pocket good gains after a buying stampede and wait for the next opportunity. We may have to buy at higher levels, but, that’s how it is. It’s very difficult to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. Nevertheless, for traders who want to hold on to their long positions, the next target on the cryptocurrency is $6197. Bitcoin has support at the $5000 levels, which had been a strong resistance until now.  The cryptocurrency will not become negative until it breaks below $4800 levels. Ethereum continues to remain volatile, but is on the verge of breaking out of the range. In our last trade, we were caught on the wrong side, as the breakout was faded by the bears. So, how should we approach it now?  Even today, the cryptocurrency has formed a very large range with an intraday high of $352.52 and an intraday low of $274.67. Though prices have broken out of the range, which makes us bullish, the stop loss for the trade is very deep. After four previous false breakouts, we would rather wait for Ethereum to end the day above the range, signaling the start of a new uptrend. On a close above the range, our first target is $354, above which, a move to $400 is also possible. However, we are not recommending a trade on Ethereum until we get a closing above $317. Bitcoin Cash is not showing any interest either from bulls or bears. It continues to slide gradually, struggling to hold the $300 levels.  The cryptocurrency is attempting to find support at the $282 levels. However, the pullback from the support is not very convincing. If Bitcoin Cash breaks below the immediate support zone of $265 to $282, it is likely to retest the lows. On the other hand, any pullback is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). There are no bullish setups, therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it. As is the case with most altcoins, Ripple is also facing selling pressure. As a result, it has fallen back into the descending triangle.  The cryptocurrency is attempting to hold the 20-day EMA. It if bounces off this support, it is likely to rally towards the recent swing high of $0.28000, above which a move to $0.30000 is also possible. However, if the digital currency breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it has some support from the small uptrend line and the 50-day simple moving average. Aggressive traders can go long on Ripple if it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle, and the smaller downtrend line drawn from the recent highs of $0.28000. This level is likely to be around $0.26000. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $0.23000. We don’t want to hold the cryptocurrency if it again falls back into the triangle. The target objective on the upside is $0.30000. Litecoin is one of the few altcoins that showed strong buying support yesterday. Though we did not have a buy recommendation on Litecoin, we did mention that it will become positive once it breaks out of the range.  Yesterday, the cryptocurrency rose sharply, breaking out of the overhead resistance of $57.72. However, today, the digital currency is facing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $58 mark. If traders entered long positions at $58, please hold with a stop loss of $48. The first target objective is $71. Others who have not yet entered long positions can wait and enter above $61, which will signal a victory for the bulls. The stop loss, in this case, can be kept at $50 and the profit objective remains $71. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2017-10-14 11:50:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Delaware Judge Throws Out Case Against Blockchain-Based Payment Network Ripple,"Cointelegraph Ripple claims victory over R3 in XRP lawsuit case. Regulations In an apparent victory for the Blockchain-based payment network Ripple, a Delaware judge ruled in their favor regarding the recent lawsuit over R3 consortium’s wish to force the company to make good on a contract to buy a huge volume of XRP. The news broke via Ripple’s Twitter account: Breaking news! https://t.co/tK0tHPjQ6Z R3, the ‘Blockchain-inspired’ startup servicing banks and financial institutions, maintains that Ripple Labs has violated a prior purchase agreement for XRP tokens between the two companies. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, started the Twitter feud, indicating that the judge in the Delaware lawsuit had ruled to ‘throw out’ the case. However, after further information came to light, the judge had issued a verbal ruling regarding Delaware’s jurisdiction over the matter. The lawsuit will proceed, however, in California and New York. The case, according to others, will continue in California and New York. R3 is suing Ripple for specific performance of an option agreement in which Ripple agreed to sell up to five bln XRPs for a price of $.0085. Ripple has countersued, claiming that R3 reneged on a number of contractual promises, and is simply acting in a spirit of opportunism, after the cryptocurrency soared more than 30 times over.

2017-10-16 19:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 16","Cointelegraph Latest price review and trading suggestions on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. While on one side, the traditional money managers and investment bankers continue to voice their opposition to Bitcoin, the State bank of Mauritius (SMB) has approved the use of Blockchain assets as collateral for loans. Russia, on the other hand, is moving ahead with its own ‘CryptoRuble’, according to local news sources. Will this cryptocurrency succeed? Only time will tell. However, early investors in cryptocurrencies continue to report staggering returns. One such person to report greater than 50,000% returns was Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange. While a similar increase from the current levels is unlikely, we can still ride the trends and earn triple-digit returns in a calendar year. We have no existing positions in Bitcoin. We recommended selling our remaining positions in the cryptocurrency on October 13. Our selling price was $5650, a tad below where Bitcoin is trading now. Right now the digital currency is trading near a significant resistance from the ascending channel line. It has been unable to breakout of this resistance on four previous occasions. This is not to say that it can’t breakout. It certainly can. However, this is a good place to book profits and wait for the next opportunity. If the price breaks out of the channel, it is likely to become very positive and rally to $6400 quickly. We shall try to enter this trade if we get a good entry and stop loss point. However, if the bulls are unable to break out of the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency will either be range bound between $5400 and $5800 or correct to the breakout levels of $5000. At the current levels, we don’t find a trade setup offering us a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we are currently not recommending any trade on the cryptocurrency. Ethereum remained volatile ahead of its fork. Now, that the event is behind us, we expect the volatility to reduce. We don’t have any existing position in Ethereum, as we were waiting for a breakout and close above the range. On October 13, though the cryptocurrency broke out of the range, it closed way higher for us to enter any position. Also, due to the huge intraday swings, we have stayed away from it. Currently, it is facing selling above the $350 mark. Though it has broken above this level in intraday trading, it has not been able to close above it. If we don’t see a close above $350 within the next two days, the bears are likely to sink the cryptocurrency back towards $316 levels. On the other hand, if the bulls manage a close above $350, Ethereum can rally to $390 levels. However, as the cryptocurrency lacks momentum at the current levels, we are not suggesting any trade on it. Bitcoin Cash has been trading in a very small range for the past few days. Though the fall has been arrested, it is yet to show any buying interest. The bulls are currently only trying to defend the $282 levels. If this level breaks, a fall towards the lows is likely. However, for the digital currency to become positive again, it has to first break out of the downtrend line and form a series of higher highs and higher lows. Until then, every pullback towards the downtrend line and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) is likely to face selling pressure. After a few days of low volatility, we expect volatility to increase over the next few days. However, it is difficult to forecast which way Bitcoin Cash will move.  Therefore, presently, we think it’s better not to trade it. We had recommended a long trade on Ripple in our previous analysis for the aggressive traders. Our profit objective was $0.3. What should we do now?  Ripple is close to our first target objective, where it is likely to face some resistance. Therefore, we suggest traders to book 30% profits on the existing positions at the current levels of $0.29 and hold the rest with a stop loss of $0.26. This way, we will pocket a small profit and our remaining position becomes risk-free. If the digital currency breaks out of $0.3 levels, it can rally to $0.325 and $0.34 levels. Therefore, we want to hold the remaining position. However, once Ripple moves higher, please trail the stops accordingly. We have long positions in Litecoin at $58 and $61. Our profit objective was $71 and yesterday, the cryptocurrency reached a high of $70.466. Though we would have booked at least 30% profits close to $70, we had not recommended it. The cryptocurrency is currently facing selling at the $70 levels. Today, it dipped back to $62 levels, where buying emerged. Currently, it is attempting to climb back again. However, traders who are long at $58 and $61 should increase their stop loss to breakeven. We don’t want to see a loss on our positions after being so close to the target. If the digital currency doesn’t breakout of $67, it will again fall to $58 levels. However, if Litecoin rallies back to $70, please sell 30% positions and hold the rest with the stops at breakeven. We shall raise the stop loss once Litecoin breaks out of $71. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2017-10-19 15:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Japanese Ripple Crypto Exchange Takes Hit as Founder Arrested for Scam,"Cointelegraph A manager at a Ripple exchange has swindled $12,470 Scam Alert Ripple cryptocurrency exchange in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, was raided by police as they closed in on the manager of the exchange who was looking to make off with ¥1.4 mln ($12,470) of one of their customer’s money. Yuki Takenaka, the 31-year-old founder and head of a company operating the Ripple exchange, collected his stolen funds even though his firm was in a state of collapse and unable to make refunds at that time. It is the first arrest in Japan made in connection with a bourse of the Ripple virtual currency, as Takenaka has admitted to most of the charges, according to the police. Having set up the exchange in May 2014, Takenaka quickly fell out of favour as users were unable to withdraw cash or contact him. In a strange business model, his company collected money from its users in exchange for IOUs, or written acknowledgements of debt, needed for Ripple online transactions. Users could exchange the notes with Ripple or convert them into cash. But it has also emerged that Takenaka allegedly swindled more than ¥10 mln out of a dozen users by false advertising that his company charges no commission. Additionally, there are investigations into the supposed issuing of fictitious IOUs which amount to approximately ¥120 mln. Ripple, as a cryptocurrency, is slightly different to others, as they are looking to become a legitimate digital currency for use within the banking sector; and they pride themselves on being centralised. The Ripple currency is usually used for international payments and cannot be used for merchandise purchases. Ripple is looking to break into the banking market with its tough regulations, and while this incident has nothing to do with Ripple as a currency, it shows yet again that the crypto market is still a wild west for many and there is very little protection for individuals.

Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Only a few months back, the market capitalization of the whole cryptocurrency universe crossed the $100 bln mark. Now Bitcoin alone has crossed the $100 bln mark. In doing so, it has increased its dominance to 58.5 percent, a level last seen in May this year. This shows that money is pouring into Bitcoin, whereas altcoins are getting hammered. At some point in the near future, once the leader tires out, other popular coins are likely to offer an excellent buying opportunity. Is Bitcoin nearing a top? Are altcoins ready to follow the leader? Let’s find out. Bitcoin is on fire. It has been consistently rising for the past two days. Can this rally continue? We don’t have any existing positions in Bitcoin, should we establish one at the current levels?  Bitcoin has reached a critical resistance level from the channel line. It has not been able to breakout of this channel since June of this year. A breakout of the ascending channel gives it a target of $8000, equal to the depth of the channel. However, this level is unlikely to be reached in the short-term. Therefore, we have to work with intermediate targets. The breakout from the range of $5391.4 to $5875 gives the cryptocurrency a minimum target objective of $6359. If this level is crossed, then the next possible level is $6845. Our higher targets will be invalidated if the virtual currency turns down from the current levels. As the risk to reward ratio is not attractive, we don’t recommend any fresh trade. However, investors carrying positions from lower levels should keep a stop loss of $5600. Once Bitcoin breaks out and sustains above the channel, the stops can be raised to about $5800 levels and then trailed higher. On the downside, $5875, the earlier resistance, will act as a strong support. Ethereum has been falling for the past six days. However, we expect it to hold the $275 to $286 zone, which has served as a strong support for the past month and a half.  We don’t recommend buying on the way down. We should wait for the next day or two to confirm that the support zone is holding, because a break of this support can sink Ethereum to $252 levels. If, however, the support holds, the digital currency is likely to trade in a range for a few days, then attempt to start a new uptrend. Presently, we don’t find any buy setup, therefore we don’t suggest any trade on Ethereum at the moment. While Bitcoin is roaring ahead to new highs, Bitcoin Cash has not found any buying support from the bulls. However, selling has subsided, which has resulted in small range days.  Presently, the digital currency is attempting to hold the $282 to $300 support zone. If Bitcoin Cash breaks this level, it will sink towards lows of $190. On the other hand, a breakout of $400 will signal a change in trend. Therefore, we recommend a long position only at $410, with a stop loss of $350. The target objective is $530.   We don’t hold any positions in Ripple. The digital currency is currently attempting to hold the $0.20 levels. However, buying interest has declined following the sharp reversal from $0.3 levels.  If Ripple breaks below $0.2, it’s likely to fall towards $0.15 levels, where we recommend to initiate long positions because it has not broken down of $0.145 on a closing basis since June this year. However, this trade should be taken on the way up, after Ripple confirms a bottom. Please don’t try to catch a falling knife and enter when the cryptocurrency is falling. The stop loss can be kept $0.126. On the other hand, if the virtual currency holds the $0.2 levels, it will again attempt to rally towards $0.3. But, we don’t find a reliable set up to trade this. Hence we don’t recommend a long position until Ripple falls to $0.15 levels and holds it. On Oct. 18, though Litecoin fell to $53 levels, it quickly climbed back higher and closed above $57.7. It has since then managed to stay above this support level. However, presently the cryptocurrency is threatening to fall into the range once again.  If Litecoin breaks below $57 and is unable to climb back quickly, it will invalidate the current bullish setup. However, if the cryptocurrency finds support at the current levels and turns up, a long position can be initiated at $63. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $55 and the profit objective is $71. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2017-10-23 21:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 23","Cointelegraph Latest trading review on the most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Research shows that big institutional money is currently staying out of Bitcoin. Should this worry us or keep us from trading cryptocurrencies? We don’t think so. If one were to look back in time and check, very few investors saw the potential in Amazon and invested in it. Most kept calling it a bubble. Major disruptions are not easy to understand and accept. Historical comparisons and metrics fail while judging these new concepts. Therefore, most traditional investors and money managers lose out on a great opportunity. Currently, most big names in the investment industry are in denial about the rise and popularity of cryptocurrencies. They are just praying for a crash to say, ‘See, I told you so’. The main complaint is that cryptocurrencies are very volatile. Well, with proper planning, we can certainly keep our risk under control, as we do here. Let’s see, if we can find an opportunity to make money this week. After days of rally, gravity is finally catching up with Bitcoin. So, is this dip a buying opportunity or can it fall further?   We were correct in avoiding a long position in Bitcoin around the $6000 mark. Though intraday the digital currency broke out of the ascending channel, it could not close above it. Currently, the cryptocurrency is finding support just above $5500 levels. If the fall continues, Bitcoin can correct to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), which presently lies at $5359. The trendline support is also close to this level. Therefore, we expect the digital currency to bounce from this support zone of $5350 to $5500. On the upside, the resistance line of the ascending channel will act as a major hurdle. A breakout of this will clear the path for a bigger rally. However, the RSI is forming a negative divergence. The previous two negative divergences were followed by a sharp drop in prices. Additionally, we don’t find a reliable buy set up with a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we don’t recommend any trade on Bitcoin.   We were expecting Ethereum to hold its support zone of $275 to $286, but it looks like the cryptocurrency has other plans.  When zoomed out, we find that Ethereum has formed a large equilateral triangle pattern. We can draw the trendline support in two ways (both drawn on the chart). The first level of support is at $275, where we find both the trendline support and the horizontal support. We still believe that the cryptocurrency will attempt to hold this level. However, if this level breaks, the next lower support is in the zone of $252 to $240. We believe that buying should emerge at these critical levels. We shall wait for clear signs of a bottom formation before recommending any trade.   Bitcoin Cash attempted a rally yesterday, however, it could not breakout of the 20-day EMA. After the failed attempt, the cryptocurrency is again down today. While the bullishness of Bitcoin did not rub off on Bitcoin Cash, the bearishness certainly seems to be having its effect. The cryptocurrency is falling towards the lows of the range. Though the digital currency has not broken below this low since Aug. 11, the pattern is looking weak. Chances are that Bitcoin Cash will fall below $282. If the lower levels sustain for a day or two, then the fall will extend to $200 levels. Either way, we don’t see any buy set up until the cryptocurrency breaks out of $400. Therefore, we do not suggest any trade on it at the current levels.   Once Ripple broke below $0.2 levels, the fall gained momentum. The cryptocurrency seems to be in a hurry to sink to the $0.15 levels. Now, the cryptocurrency is likely to fall to $0.166, where we expect some buying to emerge. However, the slide is likely to continue, and Ripple is likely to fall to $0.15 levels. While in our previous analysis we had recommended a buy at the $0.145 levels, we now believe that it is better to wait for a day or two and then take a position. Therefore, we are withdrawing our buy call on Ripple. We prefer to wait and watch the price action at the support levels before buying it. We shall not buy until the cryptocurrency stops falling and indicates that it is ready to move higher. Litecoin did not trigger our buy levels, recommended in the previous analysis on Oct. 21. As a result, we don’t have any positions on it. The digital currency could not hold on to the $57.7 support level. It is back into the range of $44 to $57.7. It has support at $50, below which it will fall to the lower end of the range at $44. Though the cryptocurrency had taken support at $44 earlier, we shall not buy right away. We shall wait for a day or two and buy Litecoin when it confirms a bottom. The first signs of bullishness will be when the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line and rallies above $58 levels. Until then, all pullbacks are likely to be sold into.

2017-10-25 17:38:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, October 25: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin","Cointelegraph Latest price review and trading suggestions The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. In August 2017 Bitcoin split in two, which resulted in the appearance of Bitcoin Cash, and yesterday the network experienced the second fork, Bitcoin Gold. Whether this is an advantage or disadvantage for Bitcoin is up for debate. Both sides have their own explanations. However, as traders, we look for historical precedence and attempt to trade using it. After the first fork, Bitcoin prices took off, rallying from a low of $2,621.75 on Aug. 2 to an intraday high of $4,975 on Sep. 2. That is a blistering 89.75 percent rally in a month. If history were to repeat itself, Bitcoin should rally to $10,443 by Nov. 24. That figure looks a little doubtful because most traders expect Bitcoin to fall now that the fork has been completed. They expect money to shift to the altcoins. We did see a spark of it in the last two days. However, that rally fizzled out. Can the rumor of Amazon accepting Bitcoin become a reality and give another boost to the cryptocurrency? We have to wait and watch for it. However, what do the charts forecast? Is it time to shift from Bitcoin to altcoins or will Bitcoin again attempt to resume its rally? Let’s find out. We have not initiated any positions on Bitcoin for the past few days. Is this a good time to get back into the game?   In our previous analysis, we had forecast Bitcoin to find support between the $5,350 to $5.500 zone. Today, the digital currency fell to $5,356.95 levels, where buying emerged. As there are two critical supports – from the trendline and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) – this can be a good entry point. However, we want to buy on the way up and not on the way down. Therefore, please initiate long positions at $5,650. We don’t expect a huge rally from the current levels. We expect a retest of the recent highs. Traders should book partial profits at $6,000 and raise the stops on the remaining positions to break even, if the cryptocurrency rallies according to our expectation. On the other hand, if Bitcoin turns around and breaks below $5,350 it can extend its fall to $5,000 levels. Therefore, please keep a stop loss of $5,300. The negative divergence on the RSI is a cause of worry. Therefore, we shall keep the allocation size 50 percent below normal. This is a very risky trade. Ethereum must have given some heartburn to our readers. It rallied from $275 to close to $320, and we could not catch it.  These volatile trades will be difficult to catch. At times, the support levels may break and at other times they may hold. The cryptocurrency had been falling for the past many days; therefore, we did not expect it to pullback so sharply. Nevertheless, after the quick rally, Ethereum has given up most of its gains and is back below $300 levels. Currently, the digital currency is likely to face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. It becomes bullish only on a breakout and closes above $315. Until then, we don’t see a reliable set up on it. On the downside, the trendline is a formidable support, which is likely to hold. However, as the price is quoting below both the moving averages, we don’t consider it as a good level to initiate long positions. That’s why we don’t recommend any trade on Ethereum at the moment. Bitcoin Cash is attracting some buyers at the current levels. There have been two attempts in the past three days to push the cryptocurrency higher. However, the 20-day EMA has been acting like a big hurdle on every pullback. If the price manages to break out of the 20-day EMA, it is likely to rally to the 50-day SMA, which is at $414, just above the upper end of the range. However, the logical stop loss for this trade is below the lower end of the range at $280. This doesn’t give us a 1:1 risk to reward ratio. Therefore, it doesn’t seem to be a good idea to trade. On the other hand, if the digital currency breaks down of the lower end of the range it can sink to $190. After a continuous fall from the $0.3 levels, Ripple is attempting to hold the $0.18 levels. An attempt to pullback faced resistance from both the moving averages. As a result, the cryptocurrency is again back at the $0.2 mark. If Ripple breaks down below yesterday’s low of $0.18211, it will resume its downtrend. The next stop is likely to be $0.165, followed by a retest of $0.15. On the other hand, any pullback attempt will face selling at the moving averages and the downtrend line. The digital currency will become positive only after it breaks out of $0.238 levels. Currently, there is no bullish setup. Therefore, we suggest no trade on Ripple. Yesterday, Litecoin attempted to break out of the overhead resistance of $58; however, the bears pushed it back into the range. The digital currency is again back into the range of $44 to $57.7. The cryptocurrency will become bullish only on a breakout and close above the upper end of the range. We recommend a buy on Litecoin on a close above $57.7. Our target objective is $71. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $51. On the contrary, if the bears continue to pound the digital currency, it can fall to the lower end of the range at $44. Therefore, we recommend a buy only after the bulls are able to push Litecoin out of this range. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-10-29 02:40:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, October 28: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin","Cointelegraph Latest price review and trading suggestions on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The number of hedge funds which exclusively trade digital currencies has grown to 120, with about $2.3 bln in total assets under management, according to the financial research firm Autonomous Next. While it sounds like a large number, it pales in comparison to the $3.15 tln managed by the hedge fund industry in the third quarter. Cryptocurrencies have attracted only a small number of institutional investors because most still remain skeptical. The latest criticism comes from legendary investor Warren Buffet, who has said that Bitcoin is in bubble territory. Well, a correction after such a stupendous rally is certainly possible. Therefore, we always recommend a stop loss to our readers. Even if the digital currencies correct sharply, our losses will be limited and our capital will be preserved. We can again reinvest at lower levels. We had recommended long positions in Bitcoin in our previous analysis, with our target objective being $6000. On Oct. 27, the digital currency hit a high of $5986, where hopefully traders would have booked partial profits as suggested. Where is Bitcoin headed next?    Bitcoin is currently correcting towards the trendline support at $5600. Just below this support is the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $5513. We expect buying to emerge at these levels, however, we are not certain that this level will hold this time. Our stops at $5650 have been hit. We would like to sit back and wait, because if the support zone of $5513 to $5600 breaks, the digital currency will slide to $4975 levels. On the other hand, if the support zone holds then Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound between $5600 to $6000. However, the next buy on the virtual currency will only be triggered if it breaks out to new highs and crosses the resistance line of the ascending channel. Presently, we don’t find any buy setups, therefore, we don’t not recommend any fresh trade on Bitcoin. We don’t have any existing positions or recommendations on Ethereum. The bulls and the bears are taking a break after the hugely volatile day on Oct. 22.  Ethereum has a slew of resistances from $300 to $315 levels. Therefore we recommend a long position only on a breakout, and close above $315 with a close stop loss. The first target is $353. On the downside, it has support from the trendline at $280, below which it is likely to fall to $272 and thereafter to $252 levels. At current levels we don’t find any buy setups on Ethereum, hence we do not suggest to trade on it. We had observed some buying in Bitcoin Cash but we did not recommend any trade because the risk to reward ratio was not favorable. Do we see a trade on it now?  The cryptocurrency is currently returning from the upper end of the range at $400. The 50-day simple moving average is also at $398. Therefore, we expect a stiff resistance at $400 levels. However, if the digital currency breaks out of this overhead resistance, it has a pattern target of $518. Hence, we can buy on a breakout and close above $400. We shall limit our risk by keeping a stop loss of $350. We don’t want to hang on to the trade if it falls back into the range. However, if Bitcoin Cash fails to breakout and close above $400, it is likely to remain range bound for a few more days. Both the buyers and the sellers seem to have deserted the digital currency in the past three days, as a result of which, the volatility has shrunk. However, this period of low volatility is unlikely to sustain for a long time. We should soon see an expansion in volatility.  If Ripple breaks out of the moving averages, it should attempt a pullback to at least $0.23955 levels, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $0.29699 to $0.18211. If the virtual currency breaks out of this level, then a rally to $0.25311 and $0.27241 is also possible. Therefore, we recommend a long position at $0.22 with a stop loss of $0.19650. As this is a risky trade, we suggest using only about 30 percent of the usual allocation. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout on the upside, it can drift down to $1.8211 levels. Litecoin has not been able to breakout of the range of $44 to $57.7. Therefore, our buy levels were not triggered.    The 50-day SMA is situated at $55.59, while the 20-day EMA is at $56.57. Just above the moving averages is the upper end of the range at $57.729. If the digital currency breaks out of all these resistances, chances are that it will start a new uptrend. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation provided in our previous analysis. Please buy on a breakout and close above $57.7. The stop loss is $51, whereas the target objective is $71. If Litecoin fails to breakout of the overhead resistance, it will fall back towards the $52 levels. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-10-31 02:40:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, October 30","Cointelegraph Bitcoin trading might be back to China; Warren Buffett fearing the bubble, and more. How has the market responded? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. A bullish rumor doing the rounds was that the Chinese ban on bitcoin trading is likely to be lifted. That news boosted Bitcoin’s price higher yesterday. However, a parting message by Huobi poured cold water on the expectations. As a result, Bitcoin prices are correcting from their highs. While Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, and a few others are warning of a bubble in Bitcoin, the legendary investor Bill Miller is smiling away to the bank. His fund is up 70% this year. Miller had invested about 30% of his fund’s assets in Bitcoin in early-2016. Elsewhere, a few central banks are trying to stifle the use of Bitcoin by banning it. Nevertheless, the beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they are not controlled by anyone. The market shall decide the value. Though the ban might make it difficult to use Bitcoin in the marketplace, it is unlikely to affect trading activity. Bitcoin has rebounded sharply from the trendline support and is attempting to breakout of the ascending channel. On Sunday, the cryptocurrency broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel, but could not sustain it. Though the ascending channel has been a stiff resistance and the RSI is also showing a negative divergence, we believe that if the digital currency again breaks out of the channel, it is likely to gain momentum and rally towards its target objective of $6845. Therefore, we recommend a buy at $6400 with a close stop loss of $6000. However, this is a risky trade, therefore, please use only 30% of the usual allocation. If the cryptocurrency fails to breakout and sustain above the resistance line of the ascending channel, it can again fall to the trendline support. It will become negative, only if it breaks down of the trendline support and the 20-day exponential moving average, which is at $5623. Ethereum continues to trade in a range. It has still not been able to breakout of the overhead resistance at $315.  If the cryptocurrency breaks out of the resistance at $315, chances are that it will start a new uptrend. This time, we expect ethereum to breakout of $353 and head higher towards $366 levels. Therefore, we recommend a buy on Ethereum at $319 with a stop loss of $289. Partial profits can be booked at $350 levels and the stop loss on the remaining position can be trailed higher. On the other hand, if the digital currency fails to break out of the range, a fall to the trendline is likely. Ethereum will become negative if it breaks down and sustains below the trendline. Therefore, we recommend a buy, only on a breakout. Traders who initiated long positions on our recommendation would have earned a quick 22% return within a day. They would have entered at $422 and exit at the target objective of $518 on October 29. Bitcoin Cash broke out of the range on October 28 and has been sustaining above it since then. This is a bullish sign. Next, the cryptocurrency is likely to rally to $549 levels, where it can face some resistance, but if the bulls’ breakout of this overhead resistance, a move to $700 is possible. We, however, don’t find any reliable buy set up at the current levels, which offers us a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, we don’t recommend any long position at the current levels. We shall wait for a small consolidation to re-establish the positions. Ripple has still not triggered our buy levels. It continues to trade in a tight range. The longer it trades in this range, the farther it will run when it starts a new uptrend or downtrend. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation on Ripple at $0.22, on a breakout above the moving averages. The stop loss should be kept at $0.19659. The breakout is likely to carry the digital currency to $0.23955 and $0.25311 levels, which are 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $0.29699 to $0.18211. Traders should raise their stops to breakeven once the cryptocurrency rallies to $0.23955. We suggest booking partial profits at $0.25311. The stop loss on the remaining position should be trailed higher. If the breakout fails to sustain, ripple is likely to remain range bound for a few more days. It will become negative only on a breakdown below $0.18211. Litecoin has still not closed above the range of $44 to $57.7. Therefore, our buy levels from the previous analysis have still not triggered.   Litecoin continues to consolidate near the upper end of the range, therefore, we are modifying our previous buy recommendation. We, now, recommend buying Litecoin at $59 with a stop loss of $53. Our profit objective remains $71, where we recommend booking 50% profits. The remaining position can be held with a trailing stop loss because if the digital currency breaks out of $71, it can rally to $82 levels. However, if the cryptocurrency fails to breakout and sustain above the range, it can again fall towards the $51 levels. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-11-13 21:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, November 13","Cointelegraph Trader’s view on most popular cryptocurrencies price movement. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Bitcoin’s expected SegWit2x hard fork did not materialize, which led to large-scale dumping of the cryptocurrency. This awakened the sleeping giant, Bitcoin Cash, which surprised everyone with its huge vertical rally. Instead of Ethereum flippening Bitcoin for the leader’s position, Bitcoin Cash flipped Ethereum to take the second spot. However, gravity caught up with Bitcoin Cash helping Ethereum regain its number two spot. Meanwhile, experts continue to provide bullish forecasts for Bitcoin, both for the short-term and the long-term. Let’s see, what do the charts forecast. After the rally from $650 to $2,969.99, the cryptocurrency had taken support at the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. In the second leg of the rally, which carried Bitcoin from $1,752 to $4,975, the correction extended to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. The current fall has retraced about 50 percent of the rally from $2,974 to $7,875. Both the previous bottoms had formed with a large range bullish bar at the lows. Today’s strong bullish move is very similar to the price action during the previous two bottom formations. However, the current rally is facing resistance at the trendline, which previously had acted as a support. The 20-day EMA also lies at the same levels. Therefore, we need to watch the $6,500 levels carefully. If Bitcoin is able to scale above the trendline, chances of a retest of the highs increase. On the other hand, if the digital currency turns down from the trendline, a retest of yesterday’s lows is likely. We don’t have a clear buy signal with a good risk to reward ratio. Therefore, no trades are recommended at the moment. A few months back, Ethereum was the darling of the traders. However, of late, it has not generated any notable buying interest. Is the scenario about to change?  Ethereum has been trading within the range of $280 to $315. The bulls successfully broke out and closed above the overhead resistance on two occasions, but they could not sustain the rally. However, the third breakout of the range is likely to be successful. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the cryptocurrency at a close above $315. Stop loss should be kept at $280. The first target objective is $353; however, it is expected to be broken. Hence, once prices rally to $353, please raise the stops to breakeven. Book 50 percent profits at the $367 mark and trail the stops higher. We had correctly spotted the rally in Bitcoin Cash in the initial stages. The moves the price experienced over the last couple of days, usually, end up hurting a lot of buyers who arrive late to the party, on fears of having missed out on the rally. Therefore, many times, we prefer to miss a rally if we don’t have a good risk to reward ratio, rather than jump in and repent later.  Currently, Bitcoin Cash is correcting the mind-boggling rally, which took it from under $300 levels to $2,799, an 833 percent rally within a matter of 21 days. The usual Fibonacci retracement levels could not offer any support during the correction. We expect the digital currency to find support at the $972 levels, which was the previous high, created on Aug. 19 of this year. If the support holds, we may see a resumption of the uptrend. However, there will be a huge overhang of sellers, stuck at higher positions. Therefore, we don’t expect a repeat vertical rally. If, however, the support of $972 breaks, the cryptocurrency is likely to fall to $611 levels. We don’t find any buy setups on Bitcoin Cash; hence, we are not recommending any trade on it. Ripple has been a laggard. The bulls have not shown any buying interest, even when the other altcoins were on fire. Ripple has been trading within the narrow range of $0.18 on the lower end and $0.22 on the upper end. Attempts to breakout and breakdown of this range have been unsuccessful. Additionally, the previous attempt to rally faced significant resistance at the downtrend line. Therefore, unless the cryptocurrency breaks out of $0.22, it is unlikely to find buying support. On the downside, a breakdown and close below $0.18 will sink Ripple to $0.166 levels. It might be a good idea to buy Ripple on a breakout and close above $0.22. The stop loss for the trade should be kept at $0.17. On the upside, we expect a rally to $0.3 levels.   Though we haven’t seen any fireworks in Litecoin, it has at least broken out of the range of  $44 to $57.7. Should we buy it now?   Litecoin’s attempts to breakout of the range have faced selling pressure at higher levels. However, the bulls have maintained their buying pressure, increasing the chances of a rally. The pattern target of the breakout of the range is $71. We suggest buying Litecoin at the current levels of $60.4, with a stop loss of $52. We don’t want to hang on to the stock if it falls back into the range once again. Please book 50 percent profits at $71 and raise the stops on the remaining position to break even because we expect a rally to $80 levels.

2017-11-16 15:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,AMEX Partners With Ripple For Blockchain Payments,"Cointelegraph XRP partnering with AMEX for overseas Blockchain payment structure. As adoption continues to grow, partnerships that utilize Blockchain technology are exploding. The most recent is an important connection between American Express (AMEX) and Ripple (XRP) to create a Blockchain-based payment infrastructure. Per the announcement, the platform is already being used. The specific application is for Business to Business (B2B) payments between US corporate customers and UK based customers banking with Santander UK. The service will provide real-time trackable payments between customers. This connection is just one in a long journey for Amex, per the company’s press release. According to AMEX CIO Marc Gordon: “American Express has a long history of integrating new technologies. This collaboration with Ripple and Santander represents the next step forward on our Blockchain journey, evolving the way we move money around the world.” The connection for Ripple is a substantial win, especially in light of recent problems with legal issues after a dispute over a huge number of XRP coins with startup R3. As the company continues to gain use cases, value in the coins has continued to climb. The XRP price at press time had risen 17 percent to $0.24.

2017-11-21 07:31:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, November 20: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin","Cointelegraph Bitcoin to $9,969? Low volatility for Bitcoin Cash? See what else. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Blockchain technology is likely to change a lot of things in our lives within the next few years. And that’s why the torchbearer of the technology, Bitcoin, continues to catch the fancy of the investors worldwide. While the debate is open about, which is the best cryptocurrency for the future, currently, looking at the demand, Bitcoin is clearly in the front. Bitcoin’s dominance is such that, the difference in market capitalization between the number one and the number two cryptocurrencies has widened to more than $100 bln. Will this gap swell further or is it time for Bitcoin to take a breather? Let’s find out. On Nov. 12, Bitcoin hit a low of $5,450.86, but within a span of eight days, the cryptocurrency has risen more than 50 percent. This shows the kind of demand at lower levels.    As Bitcoin continues to make new lifetime highs, it is difficult to become bearish on it. However, it is currently trading inside an ascending channel. The cryptocurrency is close to the resistance line of the channel. I anticipate some profit booking around the $8,500 mark. However, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of this ascending channel, it can rally to $9,969 and thereafter to $11,068 levels. In order to reach these two levels, Bitcoin will have to rally 21 percent and 35 percent from the current levels. If the breakout fails, the virtual currency is likely to fall to $8,000 and thereafter to $7,420 levels. A break below $8,000 is likely to lead to a negative divergence. Considering the overhead resistance from the channel line and the negative development on the RSI, I don’t consider any trade at the current levels to be a good idea.   On Nov. 13, I proposed a long position on Ethereum once it broke out and sustained above the $315 levels. The trade triggered on Nov. 14.  I had suggested booking 50 percent profits at $367. The level was touched on Nov. 19. I am still left with 50 percent of the positions, which should be held with stops at breakeven because Ethereum can rally to $378. At this level, the digital currency will face resistance from the downtrend line of a symmetrical triangle. However, if it manages to breakout and close above this level, the price is likely to gain momentum. The pattern target of the breakout from a symmetrical triangle is $645. I want to enjoy this ride if it materializes. Hence, I’ll keep the stop loss on the remaining 50 percent position at breakeven. The boom and bust in Bitcoin Cash has caught the fancy of many traders. However, after a period of high volatility, I expect a period of low volatility.  Both the bulls and the bears are likely to fight it out in the ring, as they decide whether to carry it higher or push it lower. Meanwhile, the digital currency is likely to remain range-bound between $850 and $1,550. This is a large range, which can be traded. I’ll wait for a fall to the $850 to enter my long positions. Contrarily, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $1,550, it is likely to rally to $2,249 levels. Therefore, I recommend a trade closer to the lower end of the range at $850 or on a breakout above $1,549 levels. On Nov. 13, I had recommended to go long on Ripple once it breaks out and closes above the tight range of $0.18 to $0.22.  On Nov. 16, price broke out above the downtrend line, the moving averages and the horizontal resistance at $.022. The closing price was $0.22713, which triggered our entry. While my initial stop loss suggestion was $0.17, I would like to reduce the risk. Therefore, I wouldn’t raise the stops to $0.20 levels. My profit objective is $0.30 levels. However, there is a possibility that Ripple will breakout of $0.3 and rally towards the lifetime highs. Hence, I think booking 50 percent profits at $0.3 and holding the rest with stops at breakeven sounds.    I had suggested long positions at $60.4 on Nov. 13, as Litecoin had broken out of its range of $44 to $57.   The pattern target was $71, a level that was reached on Nov. 16. I had recommended selling only 50 percent positions at the target objective because I expect the rally to extend to $82 levels. I’ll change my bullish view, if the cryptocurrency again falls back into the range. Think about keeping the SL on the positions at breakeven. Once Litecoin breaks out above $75,  I’ll raise the stops to $64. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2017-11-22 21:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, November 22: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin","Cointelegraph Here’s a trading review on top cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD and LTC/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Though the stock markets around the world are in a bull run, their returns pale in comparison to the cryptocurrencies. Hence, wealth managers will soon have to start investing a portion of their assets in digital currencies. In that regard, a French asset management company TOBAM has announced the creation of a Bitcoin mutual fund, which will help its clients gain exposure to Bitcoins. Even JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO Jamie Dimon has been critical of Bitcoin is likely to offer its clients access to Bitcoin futures. While many investors like Mike Novogratz and Ronnie Moas continue to be bullish on Bitcoin, commodity guru Jim Rogers has warned of a bubble. Let’s study the charts to find out if we can spot a trade. Yesterday, though the bears attempted to break the momentum in Bitcoin, their endeavor was met with strong buying by the bulls at lower levels.    The digital currency has closed above the $8,000 levels for the past two days. This shows that the momentum is intact and buyers are willing to step in on every dip. However, the bullish momentum will halt if the bears manage to push Bitcoin below $7,700 levels. On the other hand, a breakout above the ascending channel will be bullish for the cryptocurrency. I anticipate a move to $9,969 if Bitcoin sustains above $8,500 levels. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash towards the target. Whole numbers, usually, act as a resistance; hence, I expect a hurdle at $9,000. For any fresh trades, the risk to reward ratio is not favorable, as the stop loss is deep. Therefore, I am not suggesting any long positions at the current levels. For the past three days, Ethereum has been facing resistance at the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle.    If the digital currency can breakout and close above this resistance line, it will become positive. Its immediate targets are $395 and $421. However, I anticipate a breakout of both these overhead resistances. Hence, I suggest holding on to the 50 percent open positions initiated back at $315 levels. Our present stop loss is way back at $315. Let’s protect some of the paper profits. You might want to raise the stop loss on the existing position to $330, which is just below the 20-day EMA. After trading in a tight range for the past three days, Bitcoin Cash is trying to resume its uptrend. It has broken out of the small downtrend line, which is a bullish development. Traders can initiate long positions at $1,360 levels and keep a stop loss of $1,100. I expect the traders who missed out on the previous rally to buy, once the uptrend resumes. There is a small resistance at $1,400 and another one at $1,549. However, I expect Bitcoin Cash to breakout of these resistances and rally towards $1,825 and $2,054.9, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $2,799 to $851.12. Don’t initiate the long positions at lower levels because a failure to sustain above the downtrend line will indicate selling at higher levels. Therefore, please wait and buy at the suggested levels. This is a risky trade, hence, please keep the allocation size only about 50 percent of the usual. The trade on Ripple is live from Nov. 16 at a buy price of $0.22713. I had expected the digital currency to pick up momentum once it crossed above the downtrend line and both the moving averages. However, it is struggling to move above $0.245 levels. A correction from the current levels can push the cryptocurrency back to $0.22, which is a strong support. On the other hand, if it can rally above $0.245 levels within a day or two, it is likely to rise towards $0.30, which is a good place to lock in at least 50 percent profits. On the previous two instances, the virtual currency faced considerable selling at $0.3 levels. Generally, it is seen that the breakout happens on the third attempt. Hence, I believe in keeping 50 percent long positions with a trailing stop loss. A breakout above $0.3 can propel Ripple towards the lifetime highs.    Our traders are carrying long positions from $60.4 levels. I had suggested booking 50 percent profits at $71 and holding the remaining positions with stops at breakeven. However, for the past five days, the digital currency is finding it difficult to breakout of $72.   It is facing selling at the upper end of a larger range. If Litecoin doesn’t breakout of this overhead resistance soon, it will start a correction. Therefore, stops on the remaining positions can be raised to $64. Let’s at least protect partial paper profits. However, if the digital currency breaks out and closes above $72, a move to $82 or even to the lifetime highs is possible.

2017-11-25 20:18:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, November 25: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash","Cointelegraph Bitcoin uptrend remains, Dash is number 5 right now, and all the other price highlights of the week. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. With the launch of Bitcoin derivatives contract by the CBOE, we can expect more high-profile investors to enter the fray. However, as some investors believe that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble, we might see large positions being built on both sides of the trade. Hence, volatility is likely to spike for a few days once derivatives trading starts. Traders should, therefore, reduce their position size when the volatility increases. In the meanwhile, let’s see what do the charts forecast. While the bears had their opportunity to put brakes on the rally in Bitcoin, they could not capitalize on it. As a result, the uptrend remains intact and strong.     After consolidating for the past five days, Bitcoin has resumed its uptrend. The bears have one last chance to stall the rally at the resistance line of the channel; however, the chart pattern points to a likely breakout. Though the negative divergence on the RSI is still intact, a breakout of the channel will invalidate the pattern, because the RSI will trend higher. What are the targets that we can work with? A few bears are likely to attempt to fade the breakout of the channel around the $8,750 mark. Above this, the next target is $9,000 and $9,969.13. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the channel resistance line and breaks below $7,400 levels. Until then, the uptrend in Bitcoin remains intact. Until last time, we had been showing a symmetrical triangle on the charts. This week, we have drawn an ascending triangle pattern. This is just to show that the charts are dynamic in nature and formations keep developing in real time.    Our readers are sitting on huge gains, as they had entered long positions way lower at $315. Corresponding to my philosophy of taking profits at critical resistances, we have already booked profits on 50 percent of our original purchase. For the remaining position, should we book profits at the current levels or will Ethereum rally further? The pattern target from the breakout of the ascending triangle pattern is $652. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash to these levels. We should see a pullback towards the $420 levels in the next few days. Therefore, I would recommend booking another 50 percent profits at the current levels and hold the remaining positions with stops at $390. I will raise the stops on the existing positions again within the next few days.   After the correction, Bitcoin Cash has resumed its uptrend and our traders must be carrying long positions from $1,360 levels, as advised in the previous analysis.  Presently, the digital currency is in a pullback, having reached close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $2,800 to $854.3135. If Bitcoin Cash holds the critical support level of $1,507, it will indicate strength. The ensuing rally is likely to breakout of $1,827 and move up to $2,056 levels, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. On the other hand, if the support at $1,507 fails, the digital currency is likely to fall back into the range. As I don’t believe in carrying huge risk, I recommend raising the stops to breakeven. Ripple has been a huge disappointment. It has not gained momentum even after breaking out of critical resistance levels. I hold long positions in the digital currency initiated back on Nov. 16 at $0.22713. Should we hold or fold our positions?  The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, with the 20-day EMA moving above the 50-day SMA. This is a bullish sign. Additionally, the digital currency has not given up its gains. The uptrend is likely to gain momentum once Ripple sustains above $0.245 levels. Nevertheless, as always, I want to limit my risk. So, I suggest raising the SL from $0.17 to $0.2 levels. I do not want to stick with the trade if it falls back into the range and below the downtrend line once again. My target on the upside remains $0.3, where the traders can book 50 percent profits. The remaining position should be held with a trailing stop loss. Litecoin has been nudged into the sixth position by Dash. Will the digital currency rally from the current levels and regain back its position?  I’m holding long positions in Litecoin from the $60.4 levels. The digital currency has gained momentum after breaking out of the resistance at $72. However, we may see another two to three days of consolidation at the current levels, as this is the final resistance before the virtual currency can challenge the lifetime highs. I, therefore, recommend holding the positions with stop loss at $70. If Litecoin fails to breakout of $84 within two days, please book partial profits and raise the stop loss on the remaining position. Dash has found a place in our analysis based on its stupendous run, which has propelled its market capitalization to just under $4.8 bln, making it the fifth largest coin by market capitalization.  Any cryptocurrency that makes a new high and sustains it denotes strength. Dash broke out to new highs on Nov. 12. Thereafter, it successfully completed a retest of the breakout levels at $415. Subsequent rally again made a new lifetime high. After a two-day correction, the digital currency has resumed its rally today. Its immediate target is $650, above which a move to $729.8 is also possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down to the $547 levels. As the risk to reward ratio is not attractive, I don’t recommend a fresh trade at the current levels at the moment. However, traders with existing positions can manage their trade using the above-mentioned support and target levels. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and BCH/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2017-12-01 14:01:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, December 01: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash","Cointelegraph What is going on with the crypto market’s top currencies? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The huge volatility in Bitcoin on Nov. 29 caught a number of novice investors off-guard. This serves as a reminder to the traders that cryptocurrency trading should be taken seriously.  Additionally, this fall is likely to renew the debate among the believers and the non-believers. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winner, went as far as to demand a ban on Bitcoins. On the other hand, John McAfee, founder of McAfee Associates, has gone ahead and raised his target on Bitcoin to $1 mln by the end of 2020. Nonetheless, other than for the long-term investor, these sky-high targets are unlikely to be of much use. The trader is more concerned about the next 20-40 percent move. So, let’s try to jump into the charts and attempt to forecast the next direction. On Nov. 25, I had forecast a rally to $9,969, which proved to be a very conservative target. Bitcoin launched a vertical rally on Nov. 24, which peaked on Nov. 29 at $11,420.82 levels.  Vertical rallies are unsustainable and lead to a crash. Hence, it is good that the rally stalled. The present correction is likely to find support at the resistance line of the ascending channel. The trendline,  green color on the chart, also coincides with the channel support. So, I expect the zone of $8,750 to $9,100 to act as a formidable support. If, however, the bears succeed in breaking down this support, the 20-day EMA at $8,530 will act as the next support, below which a decline to $8,000 is possible. On the upside, yesterday’s high of $10,570.49 and the lifetime high of $11,420.82 will act as a stiff resistance. The volatility is likely to remain high for another four to five days when both the bulls and the bears will try to establish their supremacy. Thereafter, I expect the volatility to subside. The risk to reward ratio in the current volatile environment is not conducive for trading. Hence, I don’t recommend any trade today. It is better to stay safe and preserve capital than lose money in the whipsaws. Luckily, we had booked 50 percent profits on the existing positions in Ethereum at $483 levels. I had been expecting a retest of the breakout levels, but I had not envisaged a fall below $393. Therefore, I had recommended an SL of $390. Nevertheless, I was proven wrong and the SL was hit yesterday.      However, the ascending triangle pattern is still intact. If Ethereum manages to stay above the $393 levels, it is likely to resume its uptrend and attempt a rally towards its pattern target of $652. On the other hand, if the digital currency breaks down of $390, it is likely to slide to $350. Below this, a fall to $290 is also possible. I will prefer to stay on the sidelines and watch the setup develop over the next two days before any trade.      I had forecast a rally to $1,827 and $2,056 on Bitcoin Cash in my previous analysis. However, the digital currency could not breakout of the $1,758 levels.  After trading within a range of $1,507 to $1,758, the virtual currency broke down on Nov. 28. Currently, the bulls are attempting to take support at the 20-day EMA. If this level breaks down, a fall to $1,150 is likely. This is the final support, below which, the decline can extend to the 50-day SMA at $827. On the other hand, if the buyers step in at the 20-day EMA, a retest of $1,507 and $1,758 is likely. A very risky trade setup is a buy above $1,420 with a stop loss of $1120. The target objective on the upside is a retest of $1,758 levels. Only aggressive traders should take a shot at this trade and with only 50 percent of the normal position size. I had anticipated a rally to $0.3 on Ripple; however, it could not cross the $0.28 mark. From there, it plunged back to the critical support of $0.22.  I expect the $0.22 levels to hold, at least in the short-term. The rebound is likely to face a stiff resistance at $0.25 levels, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $0.281 to $0.2195. Just a few days back also, $0.25 had acted as a strong resistance. Once above this level, a rally to $0.28 and thereafter to $0.3 is likely. Contrarily, if the $0.22 level breaks down, it can sink Ripple to $0.18 levels. Aggressive traders can attempt to go long at $0.251 and keep a stop loss of $0.218. The target objective on the upside is $0.28 and $0.3. This is a risky trade; hence, the position size should be less than 50 percent of usual. In my previous analysis, I had suggested a probable retest of the lifetime highs, which proved to be correct.  However, only the nimble-footed trader would have benefitted from the rise, because the digital currency plunged to about $76 levels on the same day. The positive news is that the 20-day EMA has not broken down, which keeps the uptrend intact. The next rally will face resistance at the $93 levels and at the lifetime highs. On the other hand, a decline is likely to take support at the 20-day EMA. However, if this support breaks, a fall to $64, to the 50-day SMA is possible. I will wait for the volatility to subside before recommending any trade. I had forecast a price target of $650 for Dash in my previous analysis, which was easily surpassed. In fact, this is one of the rare cryptocurrencies that was left untouched in the overall cryptocurrency market Nov. 29.  Currently, Dash is at the resistance line of the ascending channel, which is likely to be a difficult level of cross. I expect a couple of days of consolidation before the bulls attempt to resume the uptrend. The breakout and close above the ascending channel gives it a pattern target of $960. On the other hand, any correction is likely to find support at the trendline of the ascending channel, around the $680 mark. However, at the current levels, I don’t find any setups on the charts that offer a good risk to reward trading opportunity. Therefore, I have no recommendations a trade on it so far. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and BCH/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2017-12-07 04:30:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Dec 06: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash","Cointelegraph Dash is in the treadline, Bitcoin Cash is losing it. See what else. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. When the price rallies unabated and seems to be able to reach the moon, we can be certain that a short-term top is around the corner. Can I pinpoint the top? No! Can the market continue higher and make me look like a fool? Yes, it certainly can! However, cashing in profits, especially after such a vertical run is a good strategy. I believe, it is time for Bitcoin investors to start booking partial profits on their investment positions. They will get ample opportunities to re-establish long positions at lower levels when the correction starts. The introduction of Bitcoin futures trading in just a few days will bring forth a number of short sellers who are likely to bet against the incessant rally. For the first time, the Bitcoin bulls will be face to face with the bears, who will have the tools to short sell the cryptocurrency. It is difficult to predict whether the short sellers will force price downwards leading to a long liquidation or the bulls will force a short squeeze from the bears. Considering the uncertainty, it is wise to reduce the risk. Let’s see, when should one start selling the positions. Since the low of $5450.86, on November 12, only one strategy has worked for Bitcoin, i.e., buy and hold. Traders who purchased at the lows are sitting on about 150% profits in less than a month. However, I never anticipated such a stellar rally. I kept waiting for the dip or a consolidation that could provide an attractive entry opportunity, which never materialized. Going back two years, we find that whenever the RSI reaches close to 89 levels, it has led to a correction, though not immediately. The current rally has pushed the RSI to the same overbought levels, which warns us that a correction is approaching. Where can we expect Bitcoin to top out? Bitcoin is likely to face resistance between $13380.68 and $15252.86, which are critical  Fibonacci extension levels. The target of $15252.86 is about 12% higher from the current levels. I would be wary of holding on to the currency to squeeze out the last few dollars in the trade. I recommend booking partial profits at the current levels and trailing the stops on the remaining positions according to individual risk appetite. For the traders who are sitting on the sidelines, I suggest waiting, until we get a decent correction and a low-risk trading opportunity. In my previous analysis, I had forecast a pattern target of $652 for Ethereum. A few readers believed that the level would be reached in December of this year itself.  Not likely. The ascending triangle pattern has formed over a 7-month period. Therefore, it may take even two to three months for Ethereum to reach its target objective. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all breakouts reach their desired targets. Therefore, traders should always protect their positions with a trailing stop loss.    The rebound from the $388.55 was strong. However, the cryptocurrency could not break out of the $480 levels. Ethereum has broken below the 20-day EMA. It has a strong support between the $388 to $400 levels. I expect this level to hold. Nevertheless, I don’t see any buy setups at the current levels. I will be waiting for the digital currency to show strength in the next couple of days before suggesting any trade.       I had suggested a long position at $1420 in my previous analysis. The position got filled on December 01, but the pullback stalled at the $1622.99 levels on December 03.    With Bitcoin garnering all the attention, the altcoins haven’t been able to find any buying support from the bulls. As a result, Bitcoin Cash has broken down of the 20-day EMA, which is a bearish development. However, as it is still quoting above the critical support of $1180, I suggest holding on to the position. Nevertheless, I propose to raise the stop loss from $1120 to $1170, just below the intraday low of November 30, because, below this level, Bitcoin Cash will become negative and can fall to $854 levels. The cryptocurrency will gain strength once it climbs above the 20-day EMA.   I had advocated a long position at $0.251 for the aggressive traders. The position was triggered on December 01 itself. However, contrary to my expectation, Ripple did not rally to the $0.28 mark. The pullback could not cross the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $0.281 to $0.2195 levels. After remaining in a range for three days, the price broke down on December 05. Yesterday, it broke below our stop loss of $0.2195. Now, the virtual currency can extend its fall to $0.19 levels. Litecoin is another currency that is showing considerable strength. It clocked a new lifetime high of $106.334 on December 03. However, it finds it difficult to break out of the resistance line of the ascending channel. The RSI is also forming a negative divergence, which is a bearish development. If Litecoin doesn’t break out of the overhead resistance within a day or two, it is likely to fall to the 20-day EMA. On the other hand, if it breaks out of the overhead resistance at $105, it will continue its uptrend and rally to $125 levels. As I don’t find any buy setups at the current levels, I am not advising any trade on it. I had forecast that Dash would experience difficulties breaking out of the ascending channel in the previous analysis, and that is what happened. After consolidating near the highs for three days, the digital currency broke down on December 05. It has extended its fall and is threatening to break down the trendline support of the ascending channel. The next support is at the 20-day EMA, at $640 and if this level also breaks, the cryptocurrency can fall to $605.66 levels, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $266.99 to $815. I will be expecting the pullback to end before suggesting any trade. It is better to remain on the sidelines until then, I believe. * BTC/USD, ETH/USD, LTC/USD and BCH/USD market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move is risky, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Bitcoin is on the cusp of mass adoption, with futures trading starting on the CBOE from 6 p.m. ET on Sunday and on the CME from December 18. After the buying frenzy of the past few days, the question in everybody's mind is whether the trading in futures will boost prices higher or will the short sellers use the opportunity to sink prices lower. This is an unprecedented event; hence, it is very difficult to forecast the final outcome. Nevertheless, the volatility is likely to remain high in the first few hours and days of futures trading, as both the bulls and the bears slug it out at the CBOE. While the intraday traders can use the opportunity to profit from the volatility, it will be a difficult time for the investors. Additionally, how will the trading in Bitcoin affect the altcoins? Will it be bullish or will bitcoin garner all the attention? We will get the answers next week. Until I get a clear picture, I will not recommend any trading positions at the moment. The momentum in Bitcoin pierced through the critical Fibonacci resistance levels. It hit a high of $17237.44, well above the levels where I had advocated booking profits in my previous analysis.     After three large range days, the digital currency is forming an inside day candlestick pattern. I believe that the first few hours of futures trading are likely to be very volatile. It is difficult to predict, which way will the prices move. We can only keep certain levels in mind and work with them once the volatility subsides. On the downside, support is at $12734.97 and $11344.15, which are 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally from $5450.86 to $17237.44. On the upside, if price breaks out to new highs, its next level of resistance is the Fibonacci extension level of $18281.68. These levels are only guidelines. Tomorrow, Bitcoin can easily breakout or breakdown of these, hence, please trade with caution. I recommend staying on the sidelines for the next couple of days, unless one is an experienced intraday trader. Ethereum has been consolidating between $390 and $480 since breaking out of the ascending triangle pattern.    For the second time, $390 acted as a strong support level on December 07. As the bears are unable to sink the digital currency below $390, the bulls will attempt a breakout above $480. If successful, Ethereum is likely to quickly rally towards its pattern target of $652. On the other hand, if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the support levels of $390, the bullish view and the higher pattern targets will be invalidated. Therefore, traders can keep their stop-loss marginally lower than $390. Yesterday, Bitcoin Cash dipped below our stop loss levels; so I shall consider the position as closed. However, the dip proved to be temporary, as prices again recovered quickly.  Bitcoin Cash has become range-bound between $1129.33 on the lower end and $1758.4 on the upper end. At the current levels, it is right in the middle of the range. I suggest buying on a breakout above $1760 levels or waiting for a dip towards $1129 for initiating any fresh positions. A breakout of the range has a pattern target of $2387, above which, a retest of the high is possible. On the other hand, if the digital currency breaks down to $1129, it has support at $1000 from the 50-day SMA. If this level breaks, a fall to $854 is also possible. The fall on December 06, broke below my stop loss of $0.218. However, Ripple found support at $0.20 levels and has bounced back sharply once again.  The virtual currency has formed a large ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout of $0.3.  On the downside, the trendline of the triangle is likely to act as a strong support. Ripple will become negative only on a fall below the trendline. Until then, a rally to $0.30 is on the cards. Due to the volatility inside the triangle, the best place to buy is near the trendline support or on a breakout above the overhead resistance. Litecoin fell towards the 20-day EMA, just as I expected. From there, strong buying propelled it to new highs.  The breakout of the channel had a pattern target of $154, and Litecoin reached a high of $157.36. As the price has reached its target objective, partial profits can be booked at the current levels. I anticipate a couple of days of consolidation after which the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend once again.  The next target on the upside can be extrapolated only after the consolidation. The virtual currency is likely to find support at $140.22 and $129.612, which are 23.6% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels of the current rally. Dash fell to the 20-day EMA yesterday, where buying emerged, pushing it back into the ascending channel.  I expect the digital currency to retest the highs at $815 once again. If the bulls manage to breakout of this overhead resistance, we might see a rally towards the resistance line of the ascending channel. Dash will become negative only on a fall below $640 levels.

2017-12-15 10:19:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin Boom As Bloomberg Adds Them To Terminal","Cointelegraph Bloomberg adds the three altcoins to its terminal just as they are experiencing explosive growth. Ripple (XRP) has hit huge new all-time highs as the altcoin joins Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) in debuting on Bloomberg Terminals. News that Bloomberg had added the three cryptocurrency assets to its benchmark price tracker sent XRP soaring to almost $0.90 per coin - an increase of almost 300 percent in just three days. The publication’s journalist Lily Katz confirmed the additions Thursday. Come one, come all -- @TheTerminal has officially added ether, litecoin and ripple pricing pic.twitter.com/RDGchH5QEP This week has seen altcoins broadly return to form after several weeks of intense investor attention on Bitcoin, which also hit new all-time highs Friday of almost $17,900. ETH and LTC have surpassed short-term expectations in recent days, rising to above $750 and $300 respectively. In addition, Dash almost claimed the $1,000 price tag before correcting down towards $900, all assets following in the steps of Monero, which suddenly rallied to three times its price over the past two weeks. Markets are likely set to see further flux into and out of Bitcoin over the coming weeks as a host of hard forks make their debut, investors keen to access duplicate balances tradeable on exchanges. Super Bitcoin held its network snapshot this week, while Bitcoin Platinum, Bitcoin God and Bitcoin Cash Plus are also due to do so before the end of the year. Bitcoin Silver and Bitcoin Uranium are also planned, while Bitcoin Diamond futures are already being tracked on Coinmarketcap.

2017-12-16 19:51:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash: Price Analysis, December 16","Cointelegraph Again Bitcoin is breaking records, Ethereum has dropped pretty low, but managed to recover. See what else. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Bitcoin futures trading volume in its first week was only a fraction of cash Bitcoin transactions. Futures volume has been abysmal at $60 mln per day, compared to the cash transactions of $8.5 bln each day.   However, come Sunday, the CME will start Bitcoin futures trading. Additionally, large brokerage houses are likely to follow suit and allow their clients to trade in Bitcoin futures. If this happens, we are likely to see the futures volume pick up. Will the participation of more traditional investors boost the market capitalization of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency universe? Max Keiser who hosts the Keiser Report on RT certainly thinks so. He believes that futures trading will help the cryptocurrency market capitalization reach  $1 tln and higher. Notwithstanding, these are predictions for the long-term. Let’s look at the charts to find out the likely movement of cryptocurrencies in the short-term. Bitcoin broke out to new lifetime highs yesterday after a three-day consolidation. This is a bullish development.  The breakout opens up a pattern target of $24,291.58 for Bitcoin. However, this target is unlikely to be achieved in a hurry. The cryptocurrency is likely to face some resistance at  $20,000. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears overpower the bulls and sink the digital currency below $15,200 levels. With the start of futures trading on CME, we can expect an increase in volatility. Therefore, traders should reduce their position size for the next few days until volatility subsides. Intraday traders, however, will get ample opportunity to place bets on both sides of the trade.   Ethereum fell to a low of $610.03 yesterday, close to our expectation of a fall to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level.  The long tail yesterday shows that bulls are eager to buy the dips. However, failure to break out to new lifetime highs shows that they are booking profits at higher levels. As a result, Ethereum is likely to remain range-bound until the price breaches $610.03 on the downside or $780 on the upside. However, if the bulls’ breakout to new highs and sustain it, the next target on the cryptocurrency is $995.99. These targets are only assumptions based on technical analysis. Many times these targets are not met and we change our view accordingly. Therefore, traders should always trail their stops higher to safeguard their profits and not be fixated only on the target. We are in the money on our trade in Bitcoin Cash. So, does the chart pattern suggest further upside or has the rally run its course?    The cryptocurrency broke out and closed above the range on Dec. 14. This should have ideally propelled Bitcoin Cash towards its target objective of $2,387. However, it could not cross $2,100 levels. Subsequently, bears attempted to push the cryptocurrency back into the range. However, the bulls have managed to close above $1,758 levels for the past three days, which is a positive sign. The next up move will start once the price breaks out of $1,950 levels. Hence, please hold the positions with the stop-loss at breakeven. The bullish view will be negated once the price sinks below $1,520 levels. In our previous analysis we had recommended traders to book partial profits because we expected a strong resistance at $0.86 levels. On Dec. 14, Ripple topped out at $0.88268 levels.  On Dec. 15 the cryptocurrency pulled back to the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. Nonetheless, the lower levels continue to attract buying from the bulls. We expect the bulls to attempt to break out of the lifetime highs again. If successful, Ripple will make a dash towards $1 levels and higher. However, if bulls fail to breakout and sustain above the lifetime highs, we are likely to witness a few days of range-bound trading between $0.61 on the lower end and $0.88268 on the upper end.   We anticipated a fall towards the 20-day EMA and that is what happened. On Dec. 14 and 15 IOTA fell close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally.  The bulls purchased the fall to the critical support levels. However, the cryptocurrency continues to face resistance on every rise. The chart pattern will become bullish in the short-term only on a breakout and close above the downtrend line, above which a rally to the lifetime highs is likely. Nevertheless, if price fails to breakout of the downtrend line, it will lead to the formation of a descending triangle pattern, which is a bearish development. The cryptocurrency will become negative on a breakdown and close below the critical support level of $3.032. We had forecast a period of correction/consolidation in our previous analysis and that is what we got.  As expected, the bulls purchased the dips to $243.86 levels, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally. However, we believe that the levels between $300 and $342.237 will continue to act as a stiff resistance. We believe that after the sharp rally, Litecoin will be range-bound for the next few days. Notwithstanding, if the bulls’ breakout to new lifetime highs, then the next target objective on the upside is a rally to $497.53. Though Dash has not run away to its target of $1,199.01, it’s sustaining above $815 levels, which is a positive indication. Bears attempted to push the cryptocurrency back below $815 levels on Dec. 15, however, they were unsuccessful.  This increases the possibility of an upside breakout of $979 and a rally towards the target objective. The bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency falls and sustains below $815. Traders who had purchased long positions on our earlier analysis should raise their stops to $780 on the remaining 50 percent positions. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2017-12-18 20:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash: Price Analysis, December 18","Cointelegraph Thy cryptomarket is definitely heading to the moon, reaching $600 bln of total capitalization. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Now, with Bitcoin futures trading on both the CBOE and the CME, Bitcoin has become available to the larger players with big pockets, which includes short sellers. It will be interesting to see what will happen with the cryptocurrency when the first bear attack. However, Ronnie Moas the founder of Standpoint Research has forecast Bitcoin to reach $300,000-$400,000. He advocates investing into the cryptocurrency on every dip. On the other hand, UBS and ING have again warned that Bitcoin owners will lose their money. However, these calls by the large banks will have to be taken with a pinch of salt because they have been warning of a bubble from the start of the year and the digital currency is up about 19 times from there. Interestingly, the French Finance Minister wants to discuss Bitcoin at the next G20 summit in April 2018. A lot seems to be happening in the cryptocurrency universe. We are in for interesting times ahead. But first, let’s see what does the picture look like for the next few days. In our previous analysis, we had suggested that the cryptocurrency will face resistance at the $20,000 mark and that is what happened.  Yesterday, Bitcoin reached a high of $19,531.90, before cooling off to $17,900. We expect to see some volatility for the next couple of days. The uptrend and the momentum remain intact as long as the virtual currency trades above the trendline. Our upside target for the cryptocurrency stands at $24,291.58.   However, if the trendline support breaks, Bitcoin will become weak. It will become bearish and indicate a larger fall once it falls below $15,200 levels. What is the downside target? Once the 20-day EMA breaks, the digital currency can fall to the 50-day SMA, which is currently at about $10,333 levels. Therefore, traders should trade with a stop-loss. On Dec. 16, we said that a range bound action is likely. However, the bulls are slowly nudging price towards the lifetime highs.  The cryptocurrency will resume its uptrend if the bulls manage to sustain above $780. The upside target following a breakout to lifetime highs is $995.99. On the other hand, if the bears push Ethereum back from the highs, it is likely to consolidate between $610.03 on the downside or $780 on the upside. We had expected Bitcoin Cash to gain momentum once it broke out of the range. However, it did not happen. The cryptocurrency was stuck in a small range for three days. Nevertheless, the bulls kept the price above the critical support of $1,758. Hence, we had recommended keeping the positions open. After three days of range contraction, the range expanded today and propelled the cryptocurrency towards our target objective of $2,387. There is no significant resistance between the current levels and the lifetime highs. Therefore, we recommend that the traders trail their stops higher rather than book profits at the target levels because if the momentum sustains, a rally to new lifetime highs is also possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency sinks into the range once again. Therefore, please raise the stop-loss to $1,700. We expected to see an attempt to break out of the highs. However, the bulls are lacking momentum at higher levels. Similarly, the bears are unable to sink the digital currency below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $0.63051. When we see buying at lower levels and profit booking at higher levels, it results in a range bound action. We expect to see Ripple trade between $0.63051 on the downside and $0.88268 on the upside. The next move will start either on a breakout or breakdown of the range. Until then, the cryptocurrency will remain volatile inside a range.    For the past three days, IOTA has formed a consecutive inside day candlestick pattern. This is similar to the coiling effect of the spring. Today, the cryptocurrency has broken out to the upside, which is a bullish sign. The downtrend line is the final resistance, above which, we can expect a retest of the highs.  However, if the price fails to sustain above the downtrend line, we anticipate a fall towards the $3.032 levels once again. IOTA will become negative once it breaks below this critical support. After yesterday’s up move, Litecoin is forming a Doji candlestick pattern today. This shows an equilibrium between the bulls and the bears. In our previous analysis, we had forecast a range bound trading in Litecoin and that is likely to continue for the next few days. Support exists at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $243.86. Similarly, the bears are likely to offer a strong resistance at the highs of $342.23. The bull run will resume on a breakout and close above the lifetime highs. That will open a target potential of $497.53. We had a target objective of $1,199 and that level was reached yesterday when Dash made a new lifetime high of $1,250. However, higher levels are attracting profit booking. Yesterday, the cryptocurrency gave up half of its gains and closed well below its intraday highs. Therefore, we believe that a short-term top is around the corner. We expect a range bound action in Dash. The broad range is between $900 on the lower end and $1,250 on the upper end. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Going short or long? Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. When stock prices of companies surge, just by adding the word ‘cryptocurrency’ or ‘Bitcoin’ to their name or by announcing entry into the Blockchain technology or sometimes by pure speculation, it is a sign that things are getting out of hand. During such times, short sellers like Andrew Left, founder at Citron Research look at strategies that will help them to benefit from the fall. Similarly, we believe that with the sharp rise in Bitcoin in 2017, a few short sellers will be salivating to short in the futures market once the upside momentum wanes. However, will it lead to long liquidation or will the short sellers be forced to cover leading to a squeeze is difficult to predict. Another thing of interest will be to see whether the altcoins hold out or are dragged down along with the leader. Let’s try to find it out. In our previous analysis, we had warned the readers about a likely increase in volatility. We had also advised trading with stops because the cryptocurrency was at a risk of a deeper correction if it were to break below the critical support. The cryptocurrency has broken down of the uptrend line. This confirms a break in the momentum. Today, Bitcoin came close to its critical support of $15,200 and bounced from there. Now, the rebound will face resistance at the trendline, which previously had acted as a strong support. If the price fails to rise above the trendline, chances are that it will break down of $15,200. The lower targets are $12,505 and then $10,760 which is the 50-day SMA support. The negative divergence on the RSI also points to a likely fall in Bitcoin. Our bearish view will be invalidated if Bitcoin climbs back above the trendline. We had hinted that the bulls were attempting to breakout above the lifetime highs. On Dec. 18, Ethereum reached a new lifetime high.  However, the highs did not fix as profit booking and selling forced the cryptocurrency back below $780. The support exists from the trendline. If this level breaks, we can expect deeper fall. On the other hand, if the digital currency moves above $800, it will rally towards its target objective of $995.99. Contrarily, if the bears push Ethereum back from the highs, it is likely to consolidate between $610.03 on the downside or $780 on the upside. We have long positions in Bitcoin Cash from $1,520 levels. We had recommended the readers to trail their stops higher, instead of booking profits at the target levels of $2,387 and the lifetime highs. What should you do when you are sitting on 100 percent profits within a short span of time? You book partial profits and trail the stops on the rest. So, the traders should book about 50 percent profits on their existing positions, keeping in mind that the cryptocurrency can rally even from the current levels. We have seen that the last time, Bitcoin Cash had plunged after making a new lifetime high. Hence, it is better to pocket some of the gains rather than leave everything on the table. The remaining position can be trailed with a stop loss of $2,400. We need to subsequently raise it as the rally continues. How high can Bitcoin Cash go? The next target on the upside is $4,514.5173. Our assumption of a volatile range-bound trading action on Ripple has also turned out to be correct. Yesterday, higher levels saw profit booking and today, along with buying at lower levels.  As a result, the cryptocurrency is forming a pennant pattern. If the price breaks this formation out forming new highs, we are likely to see a resumption of the uptrend. On the other hand, if Ripple breaks down the formation, chances are that we will see a slide to the 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally. It is very difficult to predict the movement within the formation, as it is likely to remain volatile.    We had pointed out about the range tightening from Dec. 14 to Dec. 17. We expected a sharp move thereafter, once IOTA broke out of the downtrend line. The cryptocurrency has retested the highs, according to our expectations. Now what? Currently, the highs are offering a stiff resistance. We can expect a consolidation near the highs for the next couple of days. If the next attempt to break out to new high succeeds, a rally to $8 levels is expected. On the other hand, if the price fails to break out, IOTA will become range bound between $3 and $5.5. We expected the bull run to resume on a breakout and close above the lifetime highs. However, our assumption turned out to be wrong, because Litecoin broke out to new highs on Dec. 18 but could not sustain at higher levels. Yesterday, the price fell back into the range and has gone lower today. We believe that the cryptocurrency will consolidate between $243.86 and $370 levels for the next few days. A breach of either level is likely to start a new trend. Until then, range-bound action will continue. We had anticipated a range bound action on Dash. But the cryptocurrency surged new highs yesterday. The breakout of $1,250 gave a target objective of $1,500, which was reached today. Forecasting the next higher targets is difficult. Therefore, it might be a good idea for traders to trail their stops higher. Currently, a fall below $1,200 will be a negative development; hence, this level can act as an SL. That’s why we believe that a short-term top is around the corner. We again expect a range bound action in Dash with the broad range between $900 on the lower end and $1,250 on the upper end.

2017-12-22 19:02:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash: Price Analysis, December 22","Cointelegraph Although 30% down, the crypto market remains strong. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto market has fallen by  more than 30 percent. There is a combination of events that might have triggered it. Litecoin’s founder selling all his coins in this rally is certainly a sentiment breaker. This might look like he believes the elevated levels were a good position to cash out completely. While his selling doesn’t end the future of Litecoin, it certainly dampens the sentiment and we can see it reflect on the other cryptocurrencies as well. Elsewhere, a large individual trader or a group of traders placed an options bet on the New York-based digital currency trading platform LedgerX, that Bitcoin will rally above $50,000 by end-2018. Right now, it seems to be an overly optimistic assumption. However, anything can happen in a year’s time. If someone had told me in January 2017 that Bitcoin will climb close to $20,000 during the year, I would not have believed it. Nonetheless, the bull market tops out when the sentiment is overly bullish, especially with the retail traders. Using the Wayback Machine, we find that the whales have been trimming their positions, while the smaller traders have been piling on Bitcoin over the period of the year. Professional’s selling is never a good sign. Though in the past year, every fall has been a buying opportunity and the aggressive bulls have made a lot of money, we believe that, now, the traders should wait and not venture out to buy until we see some semblance of a support forming. But won’t we miss out buying at lower levels? We may! But, we will also sleep peacefully and enjoy the holidays without any major worry, should the cryptocurrencies extend their fall. We have not traded in Bitcoin for a while because we did not get the right setup to enter. Though we missed out on a large uptrend, at least we did not get caught in the frenzy. To the lucky few who are owning Bitcoin, we have warned in our previous two analysis reports that the cryptocurrency is at a risk of breaking down.  In our previous analysis, we had warned that if Bitcoin failed to rise above the trendline, it will break below $15,200 and that is what happened. The attempt to rebound off $15,200 failed on Dec. 20 and today the cryptocurrency has plunged even below our expected support levels of $12,505. We may find a number of aggressive bulls buy at the current levels of the BTC/USD pair and continue buying till the 50-day SMA of $11,000. However, we believe that we shouldn’t try to catch a falling knife. As the selling has been overdone, we may find a bounce soon, but, if it fails to sustain, it’ll break loose. We may see the fall extend to even $10,000 levels. So, let’s wait for the correction to end before initiating any long positions. We had warned the traders of a deeper fall, should Ethereum breakdown of the trendline. Today, it did and plunged.  The ETH/USD pair has a strong support at $500 and below that at the 50-day SMA at $455. If these also don’t hold, then the price will fall to $400 levels. We suggest waiting for a few days until Ethereum forms a bottom. Currently, there are no buy setups on it. Traders who followed us on Bitcoin Cash entered long positions at $1,520 and exited 50 percent positions at a handsome profit of $3,859 and the remaining position was closed at $2,400, which was our trailing stop loss. Though our revised target objective was $4,514.5173, we recommended booking partial profits because Bitcoin Cash has a history of plunging from the highs.  The BCH/USD pair rose to a high of $4,139.0893 and reversed course. It has broken below the 20-day EMA and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally from $1,145 to $4,139.0893. We expect the cryptocurrency to find some support at the 78.6 percent retracement levels of $1,785. However, this is only an expectation. We should take any fresh position only when Bitcoin Cash forms a bottom. Until then, we recommend staying on the sidelines.   In our previous analysis, we had forecast that Ripple will resume its uptrend once it breaks out of the pennant formation. Yesterday, the cryptocurrency broke out of the bullish pennant and skyrocketed higher.  The pattern target of the bullish formation breakout was $1.5 and yesterday, the XRP/USD pair rallied close to a high of $1.2. However, today, it is being clobbered. It is because of this possibility that we keep mentioning to trail the stops higher. As it has broken below the pennant formation, it has become negative. It is difficult to call a bottom, but it may find some support at the $0.6 mark.     We had expected range-bound trading in IOTA unless it broke out and closed above the overhead resistance. However, the bears have a firm grip on the IOTA/USD pair.  Today, the cryptocurrency broke down of the lower end of the range. At one point, the fall had extended to $1.1. In such a volatile environment, we would not like to venture out and buy. The sentiment is too negative. We shall wait for the selling to exhaust before initiating any buy position. It is useless to mention any support levels when traders are selling in a panic. We had forecast a range bound movement between $243.86 and $370. While yesterday, the cryptocurrency bounced off the supports, it was not spared today.  Litecoin is currently at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level, which is a critical support for the LTC/USD pair. If this breaks, we can see the fall extend to the $146.414 levels, which is the 78.6 percent retracement of the rally. We don’t want to be brave during a panic. We want to wait and watch for buying to emerge before initiating any position. We foresaw a short-term top in Dash in our previous analysis and it has been falling ever since.  We expect a strong support at the trendline in, which is just below the 78.6 percent retracement level for the DASH/USD pair. We expect this level to hold. However, we don’t recommend buying until the decline ends. The cryptocurrencies can easily overshoot on the downside. Please note that after such a sharp fall, we are bound to see strong bounces on a few cryptocurrencies. However, we believe in safeguarding our capital first and investing with a calculated risk. With this philosophy, we miss many trades; however, we are less prone to drawdowns as well. At least, let’s enjoy the holidays without any stress. *The market data is provided by TradingView.

2017-12-26 18:21:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, Dec. 26: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash","Cointelegraph Bitcoin and altcoins are gaining their positions, see what trading moves might be a good idea right now. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Even after the massive correction last week, Bitcoin is likely to end 2017 with huge gains. However, the big question is whether Bitcoin can continue its scintillating run in 2018. While there is no definite answer, most believe that the current correction is a buying opportunity as the bull run is likely to extend next year. Cryptocurrency Entrepreneur Julian Hosp expects Bitcoin to reach $60,000 next year, but he also sees the cryptocurrency falling to $5,000 in 2018. The problem is that he is not sure, which level will be reached first. Hopefully, we will be able to forecast the movements for our readers. While the cryptocurrency enthusiasts are working towards integrating them into mainstream activities, the regulators are creating various obstacles. This is likely to escalate in 2018. However, as traders, we try to profit from every possible situation and cryptocurrency movement. So, after souring the Christmas celebrations, will Bitcoin give the investors an opportunity to cheer the New Year? Let’s find out. According to our expectation, the aggressive bulls bought the dips to the 50-day SMA. After three days of volatile trading, the cryptocurrency is attempting to resume its uptrend today.  On Dec. 22 and Dec. 24, the bulls aggressively bought the dips between $13,000 and $11,000 levels, which resulted in the formation of long tails on the candlesticks. So, for now, $11,000 is likely to act as a short-term bottom. However, will the BTC/USD pair rally back to the highs? Unlikely? The pullback is likely to face resistance in the zone between $15,118.45 and $16,160.02, which are 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracements. From this resistance zone, we expect a dip back towards the recent lows. The next fall towards the $11,000 level will give us a better idea of the uptrend. Nevertheless, all throughout 2017, Bitcoin has always surprised us by rallying to new highs after every dip. Therefore, if the price breaks out of $16,160.02 levels, chances are that it will retest the highs. However, we think there are low chances of that happening. Though we expected Ethereum to find support at the $500 mark, the strong pullback surprised us. Since the past three days, the cryptocurrency is attempting to resume its uptrend.  It has broken out of the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent fall. There is a minor resistance at $787.89, above which a retest of the highs is possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair falls and sustains below $650. In our previous analysis, we had said that Bitcoin Cash would find support at the $1,785 levels and that is what happened. However, we had not expected such a sharp pullback; hence, we did not recommend a buy.  After the plunge on Dec. 22, the cryptocurrency has entered into a small range. It is facing selling around the $3,200 mark, whereas, it is gaining support close to the $2,300 levels. The intraday range has shrunk since yesterday. Within a couple of days, we believe there’ll be a large range move. If the BCH/USD pair breaks out of $3,200, we expect it to retest the highs once again, with a small resistance around the $3,650 levels. If, however, the digital currency breaks down of $2,300, a fall to $1,600 is likely. Ripple plunged on Dec. 22, but it found strong support at $0.67. From there, it rallied 57 percent to close at $1.05398. This confirms a strong underlying demand for it.  The XRP/USD pair has been consolidating for the past three days. Within the next couple of days, we expect the cryptocurrency to attempt to move up. The chart pattern suggests another leg up, which should carry it to new lifetime highs of $1.5. Our bullish view will be invalidated if Ripple falls below the trendline support.     IOTA has remained within the range of $3.032 on the lower end and $5.59 on the upper end since Dec. 6. Attempts to sustain below the supports of the range failed.  The dips below the range saw strong buying, both on Dec. 22 and Dec. 24. As the breakdown of the range failed, we expect the bulls to push the cryptocurrency towards the upper end of the range at $5.59. Our bullish view will be proven wrong if the IOT/USD pair falls and sustains below $3.032 levels. While Litecoin dipped below the support levels of $240 on Dec. 2, it quickly recovered and closed above this level.  It is currently facing resistance around the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of $272.6. We anticipate selling in the zone of $272.60 and $292.589. However, if it breaks out of $300, we can expect a retest of the highs. On the other hand, failure of breakout above $300 will keep the LTC/USD pair range-bound between $240 and $300. The fall on Dec. 22 found support close to the 78.6 percent retracement levels. On Dec. 24, the 20-day EMA acted as a strong support.  For the past two days, the cryptocurrency has been facing resistance at the $1,200 mark. If the bulls manage to break out and sustain above this overhead resistance, we expect a move to $1,338.50, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent fall. Above this, a retest of the highs is likely. The DASH/USD pair will become negative if it declines below $1,000 levels. We expect volatile trading due to the holiday season. We believe that the cryptocurrencies markets will make a decisive move next week onwards when the traders return back to work. So, please keep the allocation sizes small until then. *The market data is provided by TradingView. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-12-28 20:22:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, IOTA, Litecoin, Dash, Monero: Price Analysis, Dec.28","Cointelegraph Still down? Why the crypto market is so volatile right now and what to do about it. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market has been volatile over the last couple of days. Does the change in behavior signal a possibility of a further fall? We shall try to forecast it using our chart analysis. The South Korean government’s proposed regulations and curbs on cryptocurrency trading have dampened the sentiment. After all, the nation with a relatively small geographical territory is responsible for a sizeable trading volume, about one-fifth by some measures, in Bitcoin. Nick Colas, one of the first Wall Street analysts to cover Bitcoin, believes that 2018 will see a surge in volatility with about  40 percent falls. If that happens, timing the markets become that much more important. A buy and hold strategy, similar to 2017, might not be the best way to trade Bitcoin. We shall try to identify these turning points for our traders so that they don’t get stuck with huge losses. In our previous analysis, we had mentioned that Bitcoin’s pullback will face a strong hurdle between $15,118.45 and $16,160.02. Yesterday, Bitcoin turned down after reaching $16,494.53.  The cryptocurrency has a strong support at the trendline. We expect the bulls to attempt a recovery from here. If they are able to break out of $16,494.53 levels, we should see a retest of the highs. On the other hand, if the BTC/USD pair breaks down of the trendline, it can fall to $12,788.14 levels, which is a critical support zone. Though not perfect, the digital currency is forming a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below the neckline (drawn in orange color on the chart). However, we expect strong buying support to emerging between $10,704.99 to $12,788.14. With conflicting signals, we are unsure about the next possible direction in Bitcoin. We shall watch the action from the sidelines until the picture clears out. Ethereum is facing selling in the $728.92 - $787.89 zone, which corresponds to 61.8 percent and 78.6 percent retracement levels of the recent fall from $863 to $512.  The digital currency is now likely to fall to the 20-day EMA, which should offer a strong support. However, if negative sentiment prevails and the cryptocurrency breaks below the 20-day EMA, its next support is at $600 levels. We will attempt a buy on the ETH/USD pair only when it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line (the orange line drawn on the chart). Bitcoin Cash is resuming its decline after failing to breakout and sustain above the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $4,139.0893 to $1,733.3558.    The cryptocurrency has a strong support at the $2,300 levels. However, if the bears are able to break down below this level, a fall to the 50-day SMA is likely. On the other hand, if the bulls hold the $2,300 levels, the BCH/USD pair will remain range-bound for a few days between $2,300 and $3,200. We shall wait for a clear trend to form before recommending any trade on it. In our previous analysis, we foresaw a resumption of the Ripple uptrend. As expected, the cryptocurrency made a new lifetime high yesterday and is on its way up once again.  If the bulls manage to sustain above the $1.24950 levels, the XRP/USD pair should rally towards its target objective of $1.5. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks below the trendline support. As the sentiment across most other cryptocurrencies is negative, traders who are long Ripple should trade with an appropriate stop loss.     We anticipated an up move in IOTA to carry it towards the upper end of the range. However, yesterday’s attempt to rally faced strong selling pressure above the $3.75 mark. Today, the digital currency is back at the support levels of $3.03200 once again.  As the bulls failed to push the cryptocurrency higher, the bears will now attempt to breakdown of the range. If the IOTA/USD pair breaks down and closes below the range, its uptrend will be in danger. The final support zone is between the 50-day SMA and the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $2.62196. Below this, IOTA can plunge to $1.81512 levels. On the other hand, if the bears are unable to sustain below the support of the range, the cryptocurrency will remain range bound between $3.36990 and $5.59. The pullback in Litecoin has been facing selling pressure at the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $272.6. An attempt to break out of this resistance failed on Dec. 26 and Dec. 27. The cryptocurrency has turned down to the critical support of $240.001 once again.  The LTC/USD pair has also formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern with the neckline at $240. If this level breaks, the pair has a lower pattern target of $110. However, we don’t see a straight slide to the target objective. The bulls will attempt to hold the supports at $220 and $175.199. Whether the supports hold is difficult to predict. Our bearish view will be invalidated once the digital currency trades above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of $295.586. Yesterday, Dash attempted to breakout of the overhead resistance of $1,200 but failed. The pullback could not even reach the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of $1,250. This shows weakness.    Today, the cryptocurrency has resumed its decline. It is currently taking support at the 20-day EMA. If this support fails, a fall to the trendline is likely. We expect the trendline to offer a strong support. However, until we see the DASH/USD pair forming a bottom, we shall stay on the sidelines. Monero rallied sharply from a low of $83.02 on November 03 to a high of $469.5 on Dec. 20. That’s a massive 465 percent rally in about a month and a half.  The correction on Dec. 21 and Dec. 22 plunged the cryptocurrency to a low of $245.1, just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. However, lower levels saw strong buying, which helped the XMR/USD pair to recover and pullback to $410 on Dec. 23. However, the bears are selling at higher levels and the bulls are buying at lower levels. This is likely to lead to a range-bound trading action until one party relents. Critical levels to watch on the downside are $320 and $300 and on the upside, is $410. Monero will become bearish if it breaks down of the supports and will become bullish if it breaks out of the overhead resistance. *The market data is provided by TradingView.

2017-12-29 21:15:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Breaks $2 and Keeps Pushing in Week-Long Bull Run,"Cointelegraph Ripple price has gained 35% within a day and now the currency occupies second place by market cap in the overall crypto market. News Cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) shot up by almost 35 percent over the past 24 hours, trading at an average of $2.20 and occupying second place by market cap in the overall crypto market at press time. The massive spike comes just over a week after the coin broke $1 for the first time last Thursday. The price then dropped again on Dec. 22, but rallied back up 57 percent the same day and has been following a bullish run since blowing past $1.50 today.  With a market cap now of $78 bln- Ripple is worth more than Uber, valued at $68 bln as of December 2017 according to the Wall Street Journal. The cryptocurrency was trading stably at about $0.20 for the past six months, starting its notable growth on Dec. 12.  The investment profitability of Ripple, created in 2013, this year has surpassed that of Bitcoin.

2017-12-30 17:00:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Becomes Largest Altcoin As Bitcoiners Issue Warnings,"Cointelegraph Ripple is causing a stir on both the markets and social media as its price continues to explode. Brief Ripple (XRP) has overtaken Ethereum as the largest altcoin by market cap in a surge which has divided the cryptocurrency community. After the payment network’s token reached as much as $2.65 on some exchanges this week, investors are celebrating returns which have topped 1,000 percent in just three weeks. At the start of December, XRP traded at just $0.24. Multiple altcoins have seen astronomical gains towards the end of this year as Bitcoin’s own surge fueled copycat behavior which saw new all-time highs for assets including Monero, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. With a market cap of $91 bln at press time Saturday, however, it is XRP that has stolen the show from Ethereum, which currently has a market cap of $68 bln. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s overall market share has sunk to new all-time lows below 38 percent. Reasons for Ripple’s rise revolve around new partnerships with traditional finance, institutions keen to leverage its technology to cut costs and save time. Despite its newfound successes, however, Bitcoin figures appear wearier than ever, highlighting the project’s centralized structure and comparative lack of use cases for XRP versus the platform itself. “There is a clear mispricing here between the (past) and the (future),” BitFury CEO George Kikvadze commented on Twitter Friday. Ripple - Centralised Solution; Trust in One Company - Worth $100Bln?Bitcoin - Decentralised Solution; Trust in Mathematics and Cryptography - Worth $235Bln?There is a clear mispricing here between the PAST and the FUTURE Popular personality WhalePanda meanwhile went further, comparing Ripple’s ethos in terms of bonafide Blockchain qualities to notorious MMM scheme OneCoin. If you really believe Ripple, which isnt even a blockchain project, is the future of cryptocurrencies... then I have some Bitconnect and Onecoin to sell to you. Placeholder VC’s Chris Burniske and Blockchain technologist Preston Byrne also voiced concerns about the rate of XRP’s growth.

However, within the past two weeks, Ripple has skyrocketed from a low of $0.22 on Dec. 10, to a high of $2.47 today. That’s a whopping rally of 1024 percent within a span of 20 days. As a result, Ripple has now overtaken Ethereum as the second most valuable currency by market capitalization. Bitcoin’s dominance, which had risen above 60 percent just a few weeks back has again cooled off to 38.3 percent. As the market matures, we are likely to see a number of changes in the rankings of these currencies. Therefore, one has to keep an open mind towards all the cryptocurrencies because as traders; our main goal is to earn money. So, do we have any good buy setups for the end of the year or is it best to remain on the sidelines and enjoy the holidays, returning to trade in the new year? Let’s find out. We expected a pullback from the trendline, however, due to lack of buyers, the recovery never gained strength. Today, the bears easily broke below the trendline support, which has escalated the selling. Bitcoin has broken down of the neckline of the bearish head and shoulders pattern. If the cryptocurrency sustains below the neckline, it has a pattern target of $5,745. However, we don’t expect to see such a plunge in the short-term. We believe that the bulls will attempt to defend the recent lows of $10,704.99.  But if they fail, the bears are likely to intensify their selling. A number of long positions will start to bleed, which is likely to lead to panic selling. We see another support at the $8,000 mark. All these lower levels will come into play only if the BTC/USD pair breaks and sustains below the 50-day SMA. Contrarily, if the bears are unable to breakdown of the 50-day SMA, we may see a recovery in the new year. Yet, we will prefer to wait until the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line to initiate any position. We don’t find any trades at the current price. We mentioned that Ethereum will become positive in the short-term only on a breakout and close above the downtrend line. Yesterday, the bulls broke out of the trendline but could not manage a close above it. On the downside, the 20-day EMA has been providing a strong support. If this support level breaks, we may see a slide towards $646.08 and thereafter to $600 levels. On the other hand, the ETH/USD pair will become positive above $770 because it has returned from the $760 levels on three occasions. Between the 20-day EMA and $760, we are likely to witness a volatile range-bound trading action. Therefore, we suggest waiting until we get a clear breakout and a confirmation of the resumption of the uptrend. For the past two days, the bulls had been defending the $2300 mark. But their attempt to resume the rally failed yesterday.    Today, the bears have broken down of the critical support level of $2300. The next downside target on the BCH/USD pair is a fall to the 50-day SMA. We expect a strong buying around the $1,733 levels.  Nonetheless, we recommend waiting until there is a clear bottom in sight. Consider avoiding buying in a falling market. Ripple roared past our initial target objective of $1.5. Today, it reached an intraday high of $2.474. Traders who had purchased on our bullish prediction should close their positions or at least trail with a close stop loss depending on their strategy. After such a stellar rally, we expect the XRP/USD pair to enter into a correction or a consolidation. Therefore, we don’t have any fresh buy recommendations on it.     The bulls have successfully held on to the lower end of the range at $3.032 for the past few days. However, they have not been able to push the cryptocurrency higher. Today, the IOTA/USD pair is again under a bear attack, which is threatening to break below the critical support. If the bears succeed, the cryptocurrency will fall to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $2.62196. Yet, if the bulls manage to hold the supports once again today, IOTA will continue to trade inside the range. We shall initiate buy positions only on a breakout and close above the downtrend line. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines. The bears have broken below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. Unless the bulls stage takes a sharp recovery today, chances are that Litecoin will continue lower in the next few days.   We anticipate a strong support at the recent lows of $175.199. The 50-day SMA is also just below this level, which should also provide some support. However, if both these levels fail to hold, the LTC/USD pair will fall towards $110, which is the target objective of the breakdown of the head and shoulders pattern. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls manage to push the digital currency above the neckline at $240. For the past two days, the bulls managed to hold on to the 20-day EMA. But today, the bears have broken below the moving average support.   Dash has a strong support at the trendline. We expect the bulls to strongly defend this level. Though we shall avoid buying until we get a confirmation of a bottom formation because if the trendline breaks, the DASH/USD pair can fall to $800 and thereafter to $650 levels. We were expecting a range-bound trading action in Monero. Despite that, the bears have taken control and have broken below the 20-day EMA today, which is a bearish development. The immediate support on Monero is at $300. If this level breaks down, we are likely to see the decline extend to the recent lows of $245.1. The 50-day SMA is also at this level. Just below there is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $230.66. We expect a strong support in this zone. At the same time, we don’t suggest buying until the fall is arrested. When the markets are in a bear grip, it is a good strategy to wait until the decline ends, instead of being brave and attempting to catch a falling knife. The market data is provided by TradingView.

2017-08-02 20:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, August 2: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic","Cointelegraph Price analysis on BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, ETC, August 2 We saw Bitcoin falling Aug. 1. Having reached the $3,000 area, the price corrected to an upward trend of $2,400. Yesterday’s events influenced the correction. It was instant but quite consistent. Bitcoin did not manage to form a turn downwards at the fall peak and therefore we observed a reversal up.  If a major buyer, who purchased from $2,400, is still holding their positions, then, in the case of a fall to $2,660, the price will rebound up. Note that the number of pending buy orders exceeds the volume of orders to sale for more than a day now. If there’s no support for an upward trend, there will a turn down at $2,660 and the price will move down to $2,450, at least. Ethereum price continues to build up the uptrend structure confidently. There has been a significant increase in demand around $200. This allowed the price to stay after the breakdown of the key level at the $220 area.  An upward trend from $176 will continue until its structure is broken. Breaking it would mean that the advantage is with the bears. At the moment, it might take place at around $210. If a large buyer keeps his positions at this trend, then after a pullback to this zone, we’ll see a rebound and the growth will continue. Otherwise, Ethereum price will form a downward turn. Ripple price seems to be indicating the exit from the $0.155 to $0.175 flat. The demand volume has increased, but this growth is still difficult to call a reversal.  The price needs to settle at the upper border of the chart. Thus, it will show the obvious advantage of the buyers. If the price does not form a reversal down to $0.17, then it might move up. At a turn downwards, XRP will become flat. Litecoin is also growing a bit insecure. The price failed to settle or form a full-fledged correction. Instead, we see is a sharp decline. This suggests the demand level is not high enough. The volume of pending orders proves the point.  Litecoin price needs settling, which will indicate prominent demand volume. The current upward structure may be broken with a downward turn in the $41 area. This is the point responsible for the entire upward trend structure from $38. Ethereum Classic is trying to form an upward trend, though unsuccessful so far. Given the fact that orders to sale prevail, the price has deep resistance moving up. The current growth is the correction to the $17 downtrend.  The advantage is on the sellers’ side, that’s why a turning point will alter the trend. It will happen if ETC settles at around $15.8 and forms a turn-up. Until then, while the downtrend structure is not broken, the price will be falling.

2017-08-04 18:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic: Price Analysis, August 4","Cointelegraph Price analysis on BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, ETC, August 4 Bitcoin has managed to settle at $2,700 and move up to the upwards trend. The demand volume during the formation was less compared to the previous figures. Thus the $2,800 zone does not seem to be interesting for the majority of buyers. They seem to be waiting for the pullback.  If we look at the horizontal trading volume, it is clear, the $2,790 area has had rather large purchases. The last pullback was also seen at this point. If there is no downward turn at the $2,650 level, the price might move up. But if while pullback there’s a reversal, there might be drop to the $2,700 area. Ethereum price has formed a reversal wave with increased demand level, and there’s a correction right now. Also, this week's wave started with a short-term $176.5 to $210 reversal wave.  If the price does go up, it will pass the $265 mark, but it’s possible only in case this week’s uptrend. The $217 area is essential for the trend-like movement. Provided there’s no reversal during the pullback, the growth will be supported. Otherwise, Ethereum will have a flat down to $200. Ripple price has settled at the key $0.17 mark. At the moment it’s the most likely correction peak. In general, XRP has formed a reversal wave up.  Demand volumes look positive. We also see the amount of pending buy orders top up sell orders. Given there’s no reversal during the pullback to $0.17, chances are XRP price will go up. But a reversal down at the $0.17 point will undermine the whole uptrend structure. Usually, in this case, the price moves down. Litecoin’s insecure growth can turn into a sharp fall. Flat-like upward movement doesn’t look a trend now.  The key level is at the $41.9 area. If this mark proves itself important for major buyers in the future, a rebound and further growth will take place, when the price reaches this mark. But price settling and a downward turn at this channel will mean large trading volumes do not support the price there. Ethereum Classic has chances to form an upward turn. The price is reaching a turning point that will define the future trend.  The price is yet to form a reversal wave up at the $15.5 area; some major sales were made at this point. We saw large purchase volume in the $14.5 area in the past. If this level is still interesting to buyers, there will be no reversal, and Ethereum Classic price will rebound up, once it is reached.

Bitcoin price is forming the third wave of $1,838 mid-term uptrend. Currently, it is being decided whether we’ll see a big price hike or downwards correction to $2,800  The third wave can become the turning point. If there are new capital flows, BTC will move up. The key level responsible for the whole future of the uptrend is at $3,150. Providing no reversal down takes place during the pullback to the level, high chances the rise will remain. Otherwise, the price will have a reversal to the correction. Ethereum price has similar structure forming. The demand levels show significantly lower numbers, compared to the first wave. This may trigger a pullback.  The $246 point is breaking for the whole trend. If the price corrects to this channel without a reversal downwards, it will mean, there are still big purchases in place. In this case, ETH will go up. A reversal down at the $246 point will indicate major buyer closing positions. That way the price might have a pullback. Ripple is in the midst of its $0.1542 uptrend correction. It is being traded at the most likely pullback bottom.   Correction zone to the $0.1542 upward trend will take place till $0.17. XRP might speed up the growth. But the correction peak might be broken at $0.177 in case of a pullback. Litecoin has a big supply level at the current peak. That’s why we see an upwards trend forming.  The $45 mark will indicate whether the trend will be broken and whether it will have a reversal down. A correction peak has been formed to the $13.2 uptrend with Ethereum Price. The demand level exceeds the previous figures, and this is a good sign for further growth.  The structure needs to keep on. Otherwise, there’ll be a reversal at $13.2 and the price might fall to the starting point. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

SegWit has locked-in today. Now the network has to update its software to make sure all the SegWit transactions are stable. And there’s almost a month before the SegWit implementation.  Bitcoin price is indicating the first signs that the trend might break. This can also mean that the trend of a larger scale is in place. But $3,220 will be the turning point, as this is the last mark of the $2,619 uptrend. If there’s no reversal down, the price rise is highly likely to last. Otherwise, Bitcoin will experience deeper correction. It seems like Ethereum price has established almost reversal-free structure. The current pullback might result in bigger correction.  The upwave might get higher. But it’s important this structure remains, as capital infusion at key points helps form this trend. If there is no infusion and profits are locked in, the trend ends. This is what may happen at the current key point, $280. With a major trader locking in their profits, Ethereum will undergo deeper correction. But without any reversal at this level, the price will rise. Ripple price managed to make a new upwards wave but had no luck in settling. It looks like there’s no support at $0.19, so it may lead to deeper fall.  After the price fell from $0.2, current growth can be considered a flat wave. So the present wave down is, in fact, the $0.17 to $0.19 flat wave too. For this wave to stop, it needs to have a reversal at  $0.186; we see large sell orders there. If Ripple fails to have a reversal upwards at this point, correction stays. A sharp impulse up has ended the flat wave. The reversal at the lowest border did not happen, and this kept the trend-like structure going.  Currently, Ripple price is in the correction and if the price settles here, the growth will keep on. In case the reversal at $45.5, the point with the biggest trading and pending purchase orders volume, does take place we’ll see the whole $38 upward trend break. Ethereum Classic flat has been going on for almost a week and its exit will form a trend of the same scale.  Right now the volume of pending buy orders surpasses the amount of sell orders. It indicates strong resistance to the price falling in case of a downwards reversal. But without the reversal at the $15 flat border, the price rise is highly anticipated.

2017-08-11 19:34:53,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, August 11: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic","Cointelegraph The latest price review. Bitcoin price has formed one more uptrend wave. The rise in demand didn’t lead to the full-scale correction. That is why this trend is expected to last.  The $3,220 upwave may become the premises for flat, but this wave structure has to be broken. The current key level with the most trading volume is $3,400. The price might turn into flat if Bitcoin has a reversal down at this level. Ethereum is traded at the peak of the uptrend correction.  After a significant fall from $316, it may start deeper correction to the upward trend. The $295 mark is defining for the price future. Ripple has reached the key mid term level, which is the most likely peak of the pullback to the upward trend.  After the price settled at $0.175, we saw a sharp price hike. Analyzing the pending orders volume, the sell orders exceed the number of purchase orders. XRP has serious resistance before $0.183. That’s why until there is no upwards reversal, the downward trend will keep on. Litecoin price has formed the full-scale correction to the $38 upward trend. The following price reaction will define the trend.  As a rule, in this cases a price settles, so we might see Litecoin settling at $48. If big sells volumes will follow, there’ll be no reversal up and the fall will last. But settling at $48 along with a reversal up will indicate the rise in demand, which would mean the trend will continue. For Ethereum Classic to form a full-scale correction to the $13.2 upward trend, it would need a breaking of the $14.9 reversal. In the case of a reversal the following growth might be more stable.  The pending buy orders volume is bigger than purchase orders. That’s why a fall to the $14.9 peak and a reversal might stimulate even bigger decrease.  But with the trend breaking at $15.5, following by a reversal, chances are ETC will move up.

2017-08-13 14:48:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash: Price Analysis, August 13","Cointelegraph Top 4 Cryptocurrencies prices: review and predictions. Among the top four cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has taken the lead and is marching ahead, making lifetime new highs on a regular basis, while the others are still far away from their peaks. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has pulled the whole cryptocurrency universe along with it. The total market capitalization of the 843 digital currencies has reached above $132 bln. So, can this bullish trend continue or are we looking at another correction in the short-term? Let’s see what the chart patterns tell us. We start with the leader – Bitcoin. Bitcoin was range bound between $2,999.99 and $1,913.19 for about two and half months. The breakout of the range had a pattern target of $4,086.79, which has been reached. We should see a consolidation or a mild correction of one to three days at the current levels before the uptrend continues.  Therefore, traders who have positions from lower levels might want to book partial profits at the current levels. Avoiding fresh positions seems like a good idea until we see a small dip or a consolidation, which will give a good stop loss point. However, if the momentum continues and Bitcoin breaks out of $4,086.79, it can rally to $4,630.19. Ethereum is presently facing resistance at $323.69 levels, which is just above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $420 to $130.26; we are not considering the lows of the flash crash of June 21 for this calculation.  The current fall can extend to $270, where the currency has dual support – from the trendline and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). We can expect this level to hold. Therefore, a buy closer to the trendline with a stop loss just below it may offer a good entry point with a small risk. The first target will be $323.69, above which a move to $381 is possible. If, however, the trendline support breaks, a fall to $215 and $180 is likely. A large descending triangle is forming on the daily chart of XRP/USD. The bearish pattern will complete on a fall below $0.135. In the short-term, however, there is support at $0.15460.  Nevertheless, as Ripple is quoting below both the critical moving averages that are trending down, traders should avoid taking fresh long positions until price breaks out of the downtrend line at $0.20000 and starts a new uptrend. Until then, it’s better to stick with the other currencies that are following a definite trend. After the initial few days of volatility, BCH/USD is currently settling down. As the currency has a short history, we shall use the 240-minute time frame on it.  Presently, the price is moving lower towards the support levels of $280 and $265. The trend will change after the price breaks out of the downtrend line at about the $330 levels. Therefore, it is best to wait for lower levels to initiate fresh positions or wait for the breakout above the trendline.

2017-08-18 13:10:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple: Price Analysis, August 18","Cointelegraph Cryptocurrencies analyzed: price review and predictions. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The cryptocurrency universe has divided experts right in the middle. While one group says that digital currencies are in a bubble, the other group says this is only the start of a multi-year trend. While it’s good to know others’ perspectives, we shall focus on the chart and chart patterns to forecast the next probable direction. The markets may move against our assumption several times, therefore we always advise a stop loss, because the first loss is the best loss. So, let’s get down to analyzing charts.  On Aug. 15, we expected the fall in Bitcoin to push it towards the lower end of the channel. However, the digital currency rose from the trendline, which now becomes a critical support. For the past six days, Bitcoin has been closing above the $4000 levels, which is a sign of strength. A breakout and close above the upper end of the channel will be very bullish, which will give it a pattern target of $5500. However, $4630 and $5000 are likely to act as resistances during the next upmove. Our bullish forecast will be invalidated once Bitcoin breaks and closes below the trendline support. It will then turn the short-term picture negative, where the digital currency can fall to the lower end of the channel. The last two weekends have been bullish for Bitcoin, marked as arrows on the chart. Let’s see if the digital currency can make it three in a row.  Ethereum has performed according to our forecast. It fell to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) where it found support. Traders who entered close to $270 levels on our recommendation should trail their stop loss and book profits above $320 levels, as this has been a strong resistance for the past several days. Fresh positions can be initiated at $330, which will confirm a breakout above the resistance. The initial stop loss for the new trade should be kept at $280, just below the trendline support and the 20-day EMA. The breakout can carry the digital currency to $381 and thereafter to $400 levels. Our bullish view will be negated once the price breaks down of the trendline support.  We had advised long positions on Bitcoin Cash following two closes above the downtrend trendline. This trade too proved to be profitable for our readers. Currently, the digital currency is in a pullback that is likely to be arrested at either $458 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) or extend to $427 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement). Traders can watch for 240-minutes and buy, once the digital currency resumes its uptrend. The next target on the upside is $690. If purchasing around $500 levels, please keep a stop loss of $420. However, if prices correct and the long position is initiated around $420 levels, please keep the stop loss at $390, because a pullback that falls below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels usually retraces the whole rally completely.  Ripple continues to trade inside the bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $0.135 levels. However, if the bearish pattern fails, it is a sign of strength. Therefore, we recommend a long position on a breakout and close above the downtrend line at around $0.2 levels. Until then, it is better to trade other cryptocurrencies that are trending. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2017-08-22 14:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, August 22","Cointelegraph The latest price review on top 5 cryptocurrencies. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Within three weeks of splitting into two, the Bitcoin community looks to be heading towards another split in November. This news has put brakes on the Bitcoin rally and there is a move away from the leader to other altcoins. As a result, Bitcoin’s dominance is down to 45.6 percent, from over 50 percent just a few days back, according to CoinMarketCap. So, will Bitcoin continue to fall? Let’s analyze the charts and find out. Following consecutive closes above $4000, we were expecting a breakout and close above the channel, which never happened. Nevertheless, our second scenario of a fall to the lower end of the channel did play out according to our expectations.  In doing so, Bitcoin completed a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of its recent rise from the lows of $2650 to the highs of $4469. The pullback from the dual support of the channel line and the critical Fibonacci level shows that the bulls are still active at lower levels. However, we don’t find an attractive buy setup at the current levels. The risk-reward is not in favor of the bulls. Though a trade can be taken above the $4000 levels, the stop loss is way deep at $3550 and the initial profit objective is only a retest of the highs at $4469. Due to a large stop loss, we are not advising any buy on the digital currency today. Bitcoin remains bullish as long as it trades in the uptrending channel and above the 20-day exponential moving average and the 50-day simple moving average. The first sign of trouble for the bulls will be when price breaks down and closes below the channel. It will then signal a fall to $3000 levels. Ethereum broke out of the critical resistance of $323 on Monday, however, it could not sustain the rise and closed just below the resistance at $322.  Traders, who went long at $330 levels might want to keep their stops just below the trendline at $280. A breakdown from the trendline and the 20-day EMA at $285 can push Ethereum down to the 50-day SMA at around $245 levels. However, if the bulls again manage to push the digital currency back above the overhead resistance, it will signal underlying strength, which should result in an upside to $381 and thereafter to $400 levels. Traders with a lower risk appetite can close their position if the next attempt to breakout above $323 levels fails and the digital currency again reverses its direction lower. We got Bitcoin Cash right on two occasions. Hopefully, our readers were able to cash in their huge profits.  Now, after the stellar rise from $296.38 to $972, Bitcoin Cash pulled back close to 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels where it found support. Since then, the currency has resumed its uptrend. However, we expect to see some range bound action for the next few days. Hence, we shall not chase the price higher. If the price corrects again and successfully retests the $550 levels, traders can initiate long positions with a stop loss just below $550 levels. The first target on the upside is $765, which is 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from the high of $972 to the lows of $558.6. At current levels, the risk-reward is not in favor of the bulls, therefore we want to enter on dips when the risk is lower. After days of low volatility, Ripple is finally showing signs of action. It attempted to breakout of the downtrend line both yesterday and today, however, it could not close above our buy level of $0.2000. We, however, should maintain our buy on a close above $0.2000 because that will invalidate the bearish descending triangle pattern. A failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign.  The stop loss for the trade is well-defined at $0.1260, a level not touched since May 9 of this year. Traders can expect a rise to $0.2500 initially and thereafter to $0.3250 levels. However, this is a risky trade as we are buying in a downtrend, in anticipation of a change in trend. Therefore, please be careful and try keeping the allocation size small. Litecoin has been range bound between $35 on the lower end and $50 on the upper end since mid-June of this year. Though it broke out of the range on July 4, it could not sustain the rally and fell back into the range.  However, if the price again breaks out of $50 levels, we expect the uptrend to resume, which has a pattern target of $65. On the other hand, a breakdown below the trendline, can push the cryptocurrency back to the lower end of the channel. There is no trade within the range. Therefore, traders should initiate a trade only on a breakout above the overhead resistance of $50. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-08-26 15:30:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Analysis of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, August 25","Cointelegraph Cointelegraph latest price review. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Jackson Hole Symposium is starting today. Though the equity markets are calm heading into the meeting of the central bankers, analysts will closely watch every statement of the US Fed chair Janet Yellen and the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. It will be interesting to note whether the cryptocurrencies also respond to their speeches. Let’s see what the important levels to watch are in case of a rally or a fall following the central banker’s rhetoric. Bitcoin is close to retesting the lifetime high at $4469. A breakout and close above this level will signal strength, and a rally towards the upper end of the channel at about $4630 levels is likely.  If the cryptocurrency breaks out of the channel, chances are that price will rise vertically, but the rally is unlikely to be sustained. Therefore, in case of a breakout above $4630, traders should trail their stops closely. The next target should be reaching the psychologically important level of $5000, which should act as a strong resistance. Traders who are long from lower levels should book partial profits and continue to hold their remaining positions with close stop losses, because there is always resistance at the previous lifetime highs. We don’t recommend initiating new positions at the current levels because the risk-reward is not attractive, as the logical stop loss is way deeper at about $3900 levels. Until the digital currency breaks down and closes below the channel, it remains in an uptrend. We had advised a stop loss of $280 to our readers who had gone long on our recommendation at $330 levels. As the price has moved above our buy levels, we want to further reduce our risk. We, now, recommend a stop loss of $290, below which the digital currency is likely to fall to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $247.  The cryptocurrency will pick up momentum once it breaks out of $345 levels. Its first target objective is $381, above which a move to $400 is also possible. However, traders are requested to raise their stops to $310 levels as soon as Ethereum breaks out of $345, and thereafter trail stops higher to protect their profits. We were correct to avoid chasing the price higher. According to our expectation, Bitcoin Cash has remained range bound. Though it doesn’t have a long history, after a sharp upmove from the lows of $190.1 on Aug. 06 to the intraday highs of $387.2 on Aug. 8, the cryptocurrency went into a correction/consolidation for the next eight days, before breaking out on Aug. 17.  The current leg of the correction is in its sixth day. We may see another two days of range bound action before the next move up or down. We don’t see any reliable buy setups on Bitcoin Cash, therefore, we are not recommending any new positions. However, aggressive traders can buy a successful retest of $550 levels or a breakout above $736 with close stop losses. Ripple scaled our first target objective and came close to our second target; however, it could not reach it. Therefore, traders should always trail their stops higher.  What can the traders expect now? In the present correction, the digital currency has found support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rise from $0.14749 to the highs of $0.29800. If it reverses direction and moves above $0.24000 levels, a rally to $0.28000 levels is likely. Therefore, aggressive traders can enter on a breakout above $0.24000 and keep a stop loss below $0.20100, because a breakdown below $0.20166 will be negative and the fall can extend to $0.17970. As the cryptocurrency is volatile, please keep the allocation size small. We had recommended a trade on a breakout above $50, as we were expecting a move to $65, however, Litecoin is currently facing resistance near the earlier highs. Traders who have initiated long positions on our advice should keep a stop loss of $46. We don’t want to hold the digital currency if it again falls back below $50 levels.  Nevertheless, as long as LTC sustains above the $50 levels, it signals strength and a move to $65 is likely. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-08-29 17:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, August 29","Cointelegraph The latest price review on top 5 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Bitcoin’s dominance is down to 44.7 percent because, while the leader has been consolidating near the highs, altcoins have been playing catch up. However, let’s study the charts and see whether this trend is likely to continue or if is Bitcoin ready to surge once again. As expected, Bitcoin has been facing resistance at the lifetime highs. However, it has not given up its gains, which shows its underlying strength.There is a small resistance at $4630. Notwithstanding, the cryptocurrency is likely to breakout of it and rally to about $5000 levels, where it should face stiff resistance as it’s a major psychological barrier. Therefore, the stop loss should be trailed higher to lock in any gains. A note of caution. The RSI is showing the first signs of a negative divergence, which is a bearish development if confirmed by a fall in price. Therefore, traders should keep their allocation size small. A fall and close below the channel support and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) will invalidate our bullish view. Ethereum continues to rally towards our first target of $381, where it is likely to face dual resistance from the horizontal line and the rising wedge. Therefore, it might be a good idea to take partial profits close to $375 levels and hold the rest with a close stop loss. Though we expect the rally to stall for a short while at the overhead resistance, the trend will remain up as long as Ethereum remains above the trendline. However, if the bulls manage to push through the resistance, a retest of the lifetime highs is possible. Hence, traders should continue to hold their positions with appropriate stop losses. Nevertheless, we don’t advise fresh positions above $381, as the risk/reward ratio is not favorable. Bitcoin Cash is slowly drifting down towards a support level of $550. No long trades should be initiated as long as the digital currency is below the downtrend line. Though aggressive traders can buy the breakout and close above the downtrend line, please keep the allocation size small because it is likely to face resistance at $736. If the price breaks and closes below the critical support of $550, Bitcoin cash can fall to $440 levels. Therefore, no long positions should be taken at lower levels until a new buy setup forms. Though ripple broke above our buy levels of $0.24000, it never closed above it, which shows selling at higher levels. The downtrend line is acting as a stiff resistance. If traders have any long positions, they should be squared off below $0.19200 levels, because the digital currency will become negative below this level. Any fresh positions should now be initiated only on a close above the downtrend line. Please keep the allocation size small because this cryptocurrency is volatile. Litecoin almost touched our target objective of $65. Traders might want to take partial profits at these levels and hold the rest with a close stop loss of $58, because the cryptocurrency can rally to the upper end of the channel, which is around $70. However, Litecoin has a history of correcting after two or three large range bullish closes, therefore traders should be cautious at these levels. Traders who have closed their long positions at about $65 levels had better wait for a new buy setup to form. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2017-09-02 15:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Talks With People’s Bank of China Key to Chinese Blockchain Market,"Cointelegraph Ripple investors are looking forward to the collaboration between Ripple and China tackling the country’s Blockchain market. Adoption Recently, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has visited Coinbase and Ripple on a US research delegation having talks about the “significant” cryptocurrency issue. Welcomed China's central bank, industry & academic leaders to #Ripple HQ to discuss the latest #blockchain trends https://t.co/jL3i4yYzjo As Bitcoin and Blockchain technology step into the more mass market adoption, many businesses are showing their interest to explore and penetrate cryptocurrency and blockchain platforms. Ripple investors are looking forward to the collaboration of Ripple and China tackling the country’s Blockchain market. Ripple is the creator and developer of the Ripple payment and exchange network. The company is based in San Francisco, California. ""Ripple"" is just the rename of Opencoin. The Ripple Blockchain focuses on banks, global payments, and digital exchange. China's has a huge network or connectivity when it comes to business and consumers. It is tempting for Ripple to get involved with the Chinese market because it will be a big hit to the company. China aims to widen its connection in the global trade market and the firm growth of China's existence across ecommerce will substantially require low transaction fees, cheap and fast flow of payment system. China is known to follow strict regulations and security when it comes to banking and financial transactions. In fact, recent warnings about unregulated ICOs caused certain companies catering mainly to Chinese investors to halt their operations. Ripple's business services revolve around bank-to-bank transfers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expects the company to enter consumer market in 5 years. Ripple has already confirmed the expansion of its business with China's Central bank. China is now researching on digital currency and the possibility of having its cryptocurrency. The fintech company and the China's Central Bank officials are having talks about the public Blockchain platform RCL or what they call Ripple Consensus Ledger. The delegation is to promote financial tech between China and the United States. Ripple had a presentation with the officials specifically on the nature of the public Blockchain, global payment ecosystem, and how they will benefit in applying the principle of Blockchain platform- its offer of low service fees, and fast pace of real-time transactions. Though there is no official announcement yet about the expanding business of China Central Bank and Ripple, people are looking forward to the great news and collaboration of the two entities ahead.

2017-09-06 17:20:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 6","Cointelegraph The market is extremely volatile these days. See the analytical overview to find out more about the prices. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The possibility of a war between the US and North Korea is threatening to derail the risk-on trade across asset classes. As a result, traders have been piling on safe havens like gold. Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies were also benefitting from this until China decided to crackdown on the “initial coin offerings” (ICOs). So, will cryptocurrencies buckle after the Chinese clampdown or will the fear of a war support the currencies in the short-term? Let’s study the charts to forecast the next move on the top five digital currencies. In our analysis on Aug. 29, we had predicted a rally to about $5,000 levels and had recommended to trail stop losses higher to lock in the gains, as we expected strong resistance there. Hopefully, our readers were not surprised when price corrected from the psychological barrier of $5,000. So, what should be the next course of action? Bitcoin continues to trade within the ascending channel. The correction from the highs of $4,980 broke below the trendline support intraday. However, the closing was well above it. Therefore, the uptrend in Bitcoin is intact. We shall change our bullish view only when the cryptocurrency breaks below the trendline and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). At the current levels, we expect a retest of the $5,000 levels. However, we are not sure whether the digital currency will breakout in a hurry. We, therefore, expect a range bound action for a few days. Aggressive traders can go long at the current levels with a stop loss below $4,400 and a target of $4,980. However, please keep the allocation size small, as we are seeing signs of a negative divergence on the RSI. Our analysis of Ethereum also played out according to our expectations. $381 acted as a strong resistance and price retreated from there. Comparatively, Ethereum is weaker than Bitcoin because it broke below the 20-day EMA and fell to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). However, it is also attempting to resume its rally following the sharp correction. As the price has broken out of the 20-day EMA, traders can buy at the current levels and keep a close stop loss at $318. A retest of $380 levels is likely. However, traders should keep a close watch at $354 levels, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $396.88 to $285. If price struggles to breakout at this level, consider closing the position and waiting for another setup to form. Please try to keep the allocation size small. Our bullish view will be invalidated if price breaks and closes below the ascending channel. Bitcoin Cash is presently trading in a descending channel. Both the moving averages have flattened out, which shows the possibility of range bound trading. If the digital currency breaks out of the channel, it can rally towards $736 levels. However, we don’t find any reliable buy setups. Therefore, we are not recommending a trade on it. Ripple never rallied the way we had expected it to. It has been volatile and direction less since breaking out of the descending triangle pattern. Nevertheless, it has not become completely bearish either, as it has not fallen below the 50-day SMA.  We don’t see any reliable buy setups, therefore we are not recommending any trade on it for swing traders. However, the digital currency can rally to $0.3000 levels if it breaks out and closes above the downtrend line. Traders who attempt this trade should keep a stop loss below $0.1900. This is a risky trade, therefore, please think about keeping the allocation size only 25 percent of normal. Litecoin surpassed our target of $70 by a huge margin. $100 proved to be a strong barrier and price corrected to about 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rise from $41.65 to $98.28. Since then, the price has been in a pullback. However, we expect to see some kind of a consolidation for a few days before the digital currency again attempts to breakout of the $100 levels. Litecoin is likely to be volatile for the next few days. Therefore, we are not recommending a trade on it. The current situation is filled with uncertainty. Therefore, traders should reduce their allocation size considerably and adhere to their stop losses, as the digital currencies are likely to remain volatile for the next few days.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Many experts have called the stupendous rally in the cryptocurrencies as a bubble. Notwithstanding, the digital currencies have continued their uptrend. However, as we know, nothing can go up for ever. Gravity will catch up and there are bound to be corrections in between, which will offer a good entry point again. However, sometimes the corrections can be unnerving and can cause a large dent to the portfolio. So, has the time come to cash in some profits and be ready for a downturn or is this another of those consolidations that will breakout on the upside? Let’s see the charts and try to forecast. Buyers continue to support Bitcoin close to the trendline support of the ascending channel. However, bears are attempting to defend the $4695 level, which is a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from the high of $4980 to the swing low of $4234.16.  For the last three days, the digital currency has failed to breakout of the resistance. Notwithstanding, the range of the past two days has shrunk, which signals an imminent breakout or breakdown, either today or over the weekend. If the bulls manage to breakout of $4695, a retest of the highs is likely. On the other hand, if the bears breakdown and close below $4400 levels, the uptrend will be in danger. Therefore, traders who have gone long on our previous recommendation should continue to hold with a stop loss of $4400. They should raise their stops as the digital currency moves up. However, we continue to advise reducing allocation size to less than 50 percent of normal, as $5000 is likely to act as a strong resistance and a small correction or a range bound movement is not ruled out. Ethereum is struggling to breakout of the $341, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall from $396.88 to $285. Though the bulls have managed to keep the digital currency within the ascending channel, and they have not been able to breakout of the overhead resistance.  The RSI is close to the 52 level and the 20-day EMA has flattened out, indicating a range bound trading. However, if the bulls manage to breakout of $354 levels, a retest of $381 levels is likely. On the other hand, if the bears breakdown and close below the trendline support of the digital currency, a fall towards $285 is likely. Therefore, traders who have gone long on our recommendation should maintain the stop loss at $318. Bitcoin Cash broke out of the descending channel and rallied close to the overhead resistance of $736, according to our expectation. However, we did not recommend a trade because we didn’t find any reliable buy setup.  Currently, the digital currency is trading within an ascending channel. A breakdown from which will keep Bitcoin Cash range bound. The cryptocurrency will become positive only above $736. However, we still don’t find any reliable buy setups, therefore, we remain neutral on Bitcoin Cash. Ripple has again formed a small descending triangle, which is a bearish pattern. The pattern will complete only if the digital currency breaks down of $0.19300 levels.  However, if price breaks out of the triangle, it invalidates the bearish setup, forcing the bears to cover up, thereby pushing prices higher. Therefore, aggressive traders can go long at $0.2400 and keep a stop loss of $0.1900. The first target is $0.3000. Traders can expect ripple to gain momentum once it sustains above $0.3000 levels. Therefore, only half position should be liquidated at the resistance and the other half should be held with a suitable stop loss. The digital currency doesn’t have an established trend, therefore, please keep the allocation size small.   Litecoin is facing resistance close to the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the fall from $98.28 to $64. However, it has made higher lows for the past three days, which shows that the bears are losing their momentum.  Therefore, traders can enter long positions on a breakout above $83 and keep a stop loss of $73. The target objective is a retest of the highs. After a series of large range days, we expect some kind of a consolidation to set in. Therefore, presently, we don’t expect a breakout of $100 levels. Please keep the allocation size small.

2017-09-11 17:15:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin: Price Analysis, September 11","Cointelegraph The latest price review on top 5 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. After banning initial coin offerings last week, China is expected to ban trading of cryptocurrencies on domestic exchanges. This news has started a correction in the digital currencies. It’s not the first time that China has meddled with cryptocurrencies. The market had briefly corrected when the Chinese exchanges halted withdrawals of digital currency in February of this year, and followed it up with an extension of the suspension in March. However, digital currencies continued their march northwards after a brief hiatus. Will the same story repeat again? Let’s see what the charts forecast. Bitcoin moved opposite to our forecast, hitting our stop loss at $4400. The digital currency has broken below the ascending channel, thereby ending the upside momentum for the time being.So, has Bitcoin become negative? No, not yet.  It is currently in a correction that can extend to $3749 levels, which is a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rise from $1758.2 to $4980. The 50-day simple moving average support is at $3823. We expect Bitcoin to find some kind of support between these two levels. However, until the digital currency stops falling and forms a short-term bottom, we will not give any buy recommendations. We don’t find any bearish patterns either, therefore, we are not recommending any short trade on the cryptocurrency. Ethereum also went against our forecast and stopped us out at $318. The digital currency has also broken down of the ascending channel, ending its uptrend. Currently, Ethereum is taking support at the $285 levels, just below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rise from $130.26 to $396.88.  A breakdown below $285 can extend the fall to $263 where it has a strong support. If this support also breaks, the cryptocurrency can fall to $232 levels, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level. Though we see a downside opening up, the logical stop loss for the trade is at $310. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive, especially if Ethereum bounces from $263 levels. Therefore, we are not recommending any trade on it. Bitcoin Cash is moving according to our expectation. It has become range bound between $523 and $736. A breakdown below $523 will find some support at $470, below which the cryptocurrency will become bearish and can fall to $440 and thereafter to $310 levels.  On the other hand, a bounce from the $523 levels will keep the digital currency range bound, with a possibility of a rally to $634 and thereafter to $736 levels. However, this is a very risky trade, especially when most of the top cryptocurrencies are correcting. Therefore, even traders who attempt this trade should allocate only 25 percent of their normal position size. Ripple has been trading inside a descending triangle, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $0.193 levels. The pattern target of such a break is way lower at $0.085. However, the digital currency has a strong support at $0.13500, which hasn’t been breached on a closing basis since early May of this year. We expect this level to hold.  On the other hand, if ripple breaks out of the downtrend line of the triangle, it will invalidate the bearish pattern and a move to $0.30000 is likely, with a small resistance at $0.26500. Aggressive traders can buy on a breakout and close above $0.23500 and keep a SL of $0.19000. However, ripple is not in a clear trend. Therefore, initiating any trade on it is risky. Traders who can quickly raise their stops and be disciplined should only attempt the trade. Please keep the position size small.   Litecoin did not reach our buy trigger level of $83, therefore, our trade did not execute. It is currently taking support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $42 to $98.  A breakdown below the $63 levels will be bearish for the digital currency, which can extend the fall to $54 and thereafter to $42 levels. Considering the bearish setup, we are not recommending any trade on it. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.    Thank you for contacting us!

2018-02-24 02:58:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 23","Cointelegraph Latest trading review on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Sanction-hit Venezuela started the pre-sale of its oil backed cryptocurrency Petro on Feb. 20. Just a day later, President Nicolas Maduro’s twitter handle reported raising $735 million. The Venezuelan government plans to raise a total of $6 billion through the sale of 100 Million Petros. Iran, which is also facing US sanctions is also considering developing its own cryptocurrency. If these nations successfully bypass the effects of sanctions using cryptocurrencies, this might lead to some strong steps by the regulators in the developed nations led by the US. Despite this and a few other small issues that can be handled, cryptocurrencies offer a huge opportunity that is attracting the traditional investors. Bitwise Asset Management Vice President of Research and Development Matt Hougan is one such investor who is dumping the ETF industry to go all in on cryptocurrencies.   In our previous analysis, we had forecast that if Bitcoin breaks the support line of the ascending channel, it can fall to $9,500 levels and that is what happened. Today, Feb.23, the price hit a low of $9,736.32.  The bounce from the critical support level is encouraging. This shows that the market participants are keen to buy on dips. The first test for the bulls will be the $11,200 mark where the rally is likely to face resistance from the 50-day SMA and the support line of the ascending channel. If this level is crossed, the final litmus test will be $12,200 level. Above it, the BTC/USD pair will become positive. Aggressive traders can use dips to $10,300 to initiate long positions with a stop loss of $9,400. 50 percent of the positions can be closed if the cryptocurrency struggles to break out of $11,200. Remaining positions can be held with a suitable stop loss for a rally to $12,000. This is a risky trade, hence, should be attempted with less than 50 percent of the usual position size. The bears will gain strength only if they are able to sink Bitcoin below $9,500 levels.      Our expectations of a fall to $780 levels on Ethereum also turned out to be correct. Today, Feb. 23, it hit a low of $787.  The move from the critical support levels has been encouraging, but the ETH/USD pair is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. The aggressive traders can use dips to $850 to $830 levels to initiate long positions with a stop loss of $770. Though the target objective is $1,000, traders should closely watch the price action at the $900 mark. If the cryptocurrency struggles to break out of the resistance, the stops should be raised to breakeven, and 50 percent of the positions should be closed. This is a risky trade and therefore should only be considered with less than 50 percent of the usual position size. Bitcoin Cash also fell according to our expectation. It broke below $1,200 and fell to an intraday low of $1,168.3636.        The bulls are trying to defend the critical support level of $1,150. If this level breaks, a fall to $854 is likely. A bounce from the current level will face resistance at $1,400 from the 20-day EMA and above it at $1,680 levels from the 50-day SMA and the trendline. The BCH/USD pair has been an underperformer in the past few weeks, so we should stick to trading the stronger cryptocurrencies.    Ripple broke below our stop loss of $0.95 and hit an intraday low of $0.85112. The $0.87 level is critical support. Below this line, we might see a retest of the lows.  Any attempt to bounce from the current levels will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and at $1.22961 levels. Unless the XRP/USD pair breaks out of these two resistances, it remains vulnerable to bear attacks. Another possibility is that the cryptocurrency will consolidate in the range of $0.87 to $1.23 for a few days. Currently, we don’t find any buy setups on it.          Yesterday, Feb. 22, our stop loss on Stellar was hit as it closed at $0.34884075 (UTC). The bulls are aiming to defend the support zone between $0.30 to $0.35.  If the XLM/USD pair re-enters the channel, it will be a bearish development. On the upside, the bulls are likely to face strong resistance at $0.41, the 20-day EMA, and at the 50-day SMA. We need to turn bullish and look for buying opportunities on a breakout above the $0.48 levels. Until then, it’s better to remain on the sidelines.   Litecoin hit our trailing stop loss of $210 on Feb. 22. Today, Feb.23, it fell to an intraday low of $184.577.  However, as mentioned in our previous analysis, the LTC/USD pair is one of the strongest cryptocurrencies. It continues to trade above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, and both are forming a bullish crossover, which means positive development. The current bounce is likely to face resistance at the trendline. Any fall towards the $200 mark should be used as an opportunity to build long positions with a $170 stop loss. On the upside, if the cryptocurrency breaks above the trendline resistance, it can rally to $240 and then to $260. As the RSI is in oversold territory, we had forecast a possibility of a bounce in our previous analysis. Our expectation proved wrong, and Cardano remained stuck in a tight range for the past two days.  If the ADA/BTC pair breaks down of 0.00003033, it is likely to extend its decline towards the next support of 0.0000246. Yet, if 0.00003033 holds, a pullback towards 0.00004070 might take place. Aggressive short-term traders can attempt this trade by initiating long positions once the cryptocurrency breaks out of 0.000033 levels, but please keep the position size less than 50 percent of usual. NEO broke below the critical support of $120 and fell to an intraday low of $107.97, today, Feb. 23. However, the bulls aggressively purchased the dip, and the cryptocurrency is showing signs of recovery.     There is stiff resistance at $120 from the 20-day EMA and the horizontal line. Above this, the 50-day SMA and the downtrend line at about $125 levels are likely to act as another strong resistance. Once the NEO/USD pair breaks out of the $120-$126 resistance zone, it is possible to become positive and rally towards $140 and to $170 after that. If the cryptocurrency fails to break out above the resistance zone, it might fall to $100 levels. Traders can enter long positions once the price sustains above $126 levels for four hours. EOS continues to trade inside the bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown below $7.5 levels.  The EOS/USD pair has taken support close to $7.5 levels both yesterday, Feb. 22 and today, Feb. 23. If this level breaks, a fall to $5.7917 and then to $3.4 is likely. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency pair breaks out of the resistance line of the descending triangle and the 20-day EMA at $9.27. The cryptocurrency will turn positive once it starts to trade above $9.5. Until then, it remains weak. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2018-02-27 00:45:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 26","Cointelegraph Top 9 cryptocurrency prices analyzed. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Goldman Sachs funded, Circle, a cryptocurrency-focused financial-services firm, has purchased the US-based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex for $400 million. This shows that large financial institutions are looking for opportunities to grow business in the crypto world. This move, while prices have been in a downswing, might boost positive sentiment. While a number of nations are looking at ways to regulate crypto trading, the Venezuelan government believes that cryptocurrency is an easy way out of its troubles. After the launch of its oil-backed cryptocurrency, Petro, the government has started free cryptocurrency trading courses for its citizens. Still, the success of the Petro is a big question mark for the future. Meanwhile, let’s look at the top cryptocurrencies and see if we can find any profitable trading opportunities. In our previous analysis, we had suggested long positions for the aggressive traders in Bitcoin, but it did not move according to our expectation. It turned down from $10,770.23 on Feb. 24 and fell to a low of $9,502.25 yesterday, Feb. 25, but remained above our suggested stop loss of $9,400. The bears were not able to capitalize on the weakness and break below the critical support.  Today, the bulls have seized the opportunity and have broken out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, which is a bullish sign. They have one more major hurdle in the way of the 50-day SMA at $10,745. Once the price breaks out of the $10,745 to $10,770 resistance zone, it should move towards the resistance line of the descending channel at $11,500. There is no change to our recommended stop loss of $9,400, but if the traders find that the cryptocurrency is unable to break out of $10,700, they can raise the stops to breakeven. Let’s play it safe.       The BTC/USD pair will be out of the woods once it clears the $12,200 mark. We also see an inverted head and shoulders pattern forming, which should complete in a few days. If this happens, it will indicate a change in trend and traders can expect higher levels. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears break down below $9,400 levels. Traders who follow us would have entered long positions in Ethereum around the $830 mark, as suggested in our previous analysis.    Currently, the price is at the 20-day EMA, which may offer strong resistance. But we like the way the ETH/USD pair sustained above the $808 mark on the previous two days, Feb. 24 and Feb. 25, and did not challenge the lows formed on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23. This shows that demand is at higher levels. Once Ethereum breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it is likely to rally to the resistance line of the descending channel close to the $965 mark. We find an ascending triangle developing, which will complete on a breakout and close above the $1,000 levels. This is a bullish sign. Therefore, traders can book partial profits at $965 and trail the rest with a suitable stop loss to ride the next up move. But if the price breaks down to $780 levels, our bullish view will be proved wrong. We don’t find any buying interest in Bitcoin Cash at the moment. It is struggling to stay above the critical support level of $1,150.         Any recovery attempt will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. The BCH/USD pair will show first signs of strength once it stays above $1,600 levels. Currently, we don’t find any buy setup, and that’s why we don’t recommend any trade on it.    The bulls have defended the $0.85 levels for the past five days. Ripple can now remain range bound between $0.85 and $1.22961 for the next few days.  The next leg up will start once the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the range and the 50-day SMA at $1.23. Until then, price action will most likely remain range bound and volatile. We don’t find any buy setups inside the range; hence, no recommendation on trade so far.         The bulls have hung on to the critical support zone of $0.32 to $0.35 for the past few days. But they have not been able to push prices higher. As a result, Stellar continues to languish near its recent lows.  If the bears succeed in breaking down below $0.32, it may push the XLM/USD pair towards $0.22 levels. However, if the bulls assert their supremacy, a range bound trading between $0.32 to $0.47 is likely to ensue. We are not certain about the next price move; therefore, we have provided our view on both possibilities to the traders.   We had recommended traders to build long positions on Litecoin close to the $200 mark with a target objective of $240 and $260. We assume traders would have entered long positions on Feb. 24.  For the past four days, the LTC/USD pair has been facing stiff resistance at the trendline. Currently, $240 is a critical resistance level; we can see a move to $270 and higher from there. Traders can hold their positions and trail their stops higher to break even. We think it’s better to wait and not lose money on the trade. The target objective on the upside is a rally to $270 where 50 percent positions can be closed. Remaining positions can be carried with a trailing stop loss with a target objective of $300. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency breaks below $175. We had suggested a short-term trade on Cardano in our previous analysis. Though the price broke out of 0.000033, yesterday, Feb. 25, it never reached our target objective of 0.00004070. It turned down from 0.00003520 levels. Traders can close their positions at the current levels with a marginal loss.  The ADA/BTC pair continues to be weak as it is below both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. If the price breaks down of 0.00003033, it can slide to the next support level of 0.0000246. On the upside, the zone between the 20-day EMA and 0.00004070 is likely to act as stiff resistance. Today, NEO has broken out of a slew of resistances. It has also triggered our buy level, recommended in the previous analysis. Traders who have entered long positions on our suggestion can keep their stop loss at $105.     A failure of a bearish pattern – a descending triangle pattern in this case – is a bullish sign. On the upside, $140 is critical resistance; the NEO/USD pair should quickly rally to $170 levels above this level. On the downside, the cryptocurrency might find support at $120 levels. EOS has held on to its critical support of $7.5 for the past five days. Though it had formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, it did not break down of it, and the price has reached the apex of the triangle. The pattern now stands invalidated.    If the EOS/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, it is likely to reach the 50-day SMA. We don’t find any reliable setups on it. Hence, we can’t recommend any trade on it. We’ll turn positive on it once it starts to trade above $11 levels. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2018-03-01 02:07:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb 28","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Bill Gates, a world-famous businessman and philanthropist and Microsoft corporation principal founder stated in an AMA session on Reddit yesterday, Feb. 27, that cryptocurrencies led to deaths “in a fairly direct way.” And even though crypto investors have become victims of kidnapping and robbery, this still should not overshadow the true potential cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology can bring to the society. As our readers might have seen over the past few months, cryptocurrencies should be traded cautiously. If one makes the right decision and trades using the chart patterns, trades can be profitable with a calculated risk. In our previous analysis, we had forecast Bitcoin to reach the resistance line of the descending channel at $11,500, after breaking out of the 50-day SMA. Today, the cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $11,147.99.  We believe that the zone between $11,400 and $12,200 will act as stiff resistance. Therefore, the aggressive traders should book profits on 50 percent of their positions at the current levels and hold the rest with a trailing stop loss. A breakout of the $12,200 levels will complete an inverted head and shoulders pattern, which can propel the BTC/USD pair back towards the $18,000 levels. The bears will gain strength once the digital currency breaks down of $9,400 levels. Until then, it is bulls advantage. We had expected Ethereum to break out of the 20-day EMA and rally towards the resistance line of the descending channel. However, for the past two days, the bulls have failed to break out and settle at the moving average.    If the ETH/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the trendline of the ascending triangle formation, it will be a bearish development. On the downside, $770 to $780 is likely to act as strong support. Therefore, traders can raise their stops to breakeven on half position and keep the stops at $780 on the other half position. Let’s reduce our risk. We still don’t find signs of a recovery for Bitcoin Cash. For the past six days, the price has been stuck in a tight range of $1,150 to $1,355. Both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA are turning down, which shows that the bears have an upper hand.        If they succeed in breaking down of the $1,150 support levels, a fall to $854 is likely. On the other hand, if the bulls breakout of $1,355, a move towards $1,600 is likely. We are not sure whether the next move will be up or down. Therefore, we have provided both possibilities, and we do not recommend any trade on the BCH/USD pair at the moment.    We had forecast a range bound trading action in Ripple in our previous analysis and the price action supports our view. However, instead of trading in a large range, the cryptocurrency is stuck inside a very tight range, with resistance on the upside at $0.98669 and support on the downside at $0.85.  If the bears break below this tight range, a fall to $0.72 is likely. If the bulls break out of the range, a move towards the 50-day SMA is likely. Until then, the XRP/USD pair is likely to remain range bound.         Stellar is struggling to move up. This shows lack of buying even at the current levels. When the price fails to bounce off strong support levels, it is a sign of weakness.  Both the moving averages have also turned down, which shows that the bears are in command. If the XLM/USD pair breaks down of the $0.32 support, a fall towards the $0.22 levels is likely. On the upside, the bulls will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. We remain neutral to bearish on the cryptocurrency as long as it trades below $0.48.   Litecoin went down from the overhead resistance of $240 on Feb. 26. Currently, it is trading close to the 20-day EMA, which should provide support.  We like the LTC/USD pair because the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day SMA, which is a positive sign. But if the cryptocurrency breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can fall to the 50-day SMA. We shall retain our stop loss at breakeven because we don’t want to carry a risk when the overall sentiment is bearish. On the upside, Litecoin will gain momentum above $240. Our target objective remains a rally to $270 and $300. We had suggested closing our aggressive long positions for Cardano in our previous analysis, and it turned out to be the right decision.  The ADA/BTC pair has broken down of the 0.000030 levels and is on its way towards the next support level of 0.0000246. The only silver lining is that the RSI is showing signs of positive divergence. However, we shall not venture to buy it until the price climbs above the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. Traders who follow us are long on NEO at $126 levels, as recommended. Yesterday, Feb.27, the currency broke out of the critical overhead resistance at $140, but it did not sustain the breakout.       We continue to put our trust in the NEO/USD pair because it has broken out of a bearish pattern and is sustaining above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Our target objective on the upside remains a rally to $170. The stop loss can be retained at $105 for now. Traders can raise the stop loss to breakeven as soon as the cryptocurrency climbs above $150. EOS broke out of the downtrend line yesterday, Feb. 27, but could not climb above the 20-day EMA. It has formed a symmetrical triangle. The next leg of the uptrend or downtrend will start once the price breaks out or breaks down of the triangle.     If the EOS/USD pair breaks down of the $7.5 levels, a retest of the Feb. 06 lows, $5.7917, is likely; though the pattern target is way lower. On the other hand, a breakout of the symmetrical triangle will push the price towards $10.119 levels. We only should turn bullish on it after it sustains above the 50-day SMA.

2018-03-02 15:43:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,South Korean Bank Plans ‘Commercial’ Ripple Remittances By 2019,"Cointelegraph Ripple-based remittances are set to launch with South Korean bank Woori Bank. News South Korean bank Woori Bank intends to introduce “commercialized” international remittances this year based on Ripple, a cryptocurrency-powered remittance network, local news outlet ChosunBiz reports Friday, Mar. 2. On the back of a positive test transaction by its Digital Strategy Department following initial tests in January, the bank is now looking to introduce Ripple’s technology to its worldwide remittances. The trial came about as part of a Japanese-based scheme involving Ripple and SBI Group, with 37 other institutions participating in the remittance test. Of these, along with at least 23 more involved in testing Blockchain remittances, the vast majority are Japanese banks, given the “well laid out” nature of Ripple’s network in Japan. South Korea’s second-largest bank Shinhan was also on board. “Since the test results were good, there are many banks to be commercialized in Japan,"" a Woori official commented to ChosunBiz. “Several banks, such as two or three megabanks and Internet professional banks, are pushing to introduce the practice.” Ripple has seen a further successful month despite its cryptocurrency asset XRP losing significantly versus all-time highs of early January. In mid-February, the company announced Western Union was also seeking to leverage its technology to reduce the time and costs associated with its cross-border transfers.

2018-03-03 00:48:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Price Analysis, March 02: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS","Cointelegraph If you trade, you can’t miss this. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Bitcoin trading volume is languishing at about half of the average seen during its December peak. While a few believe that this is a sign of an approaching bear market in Bitcoin, we don’t agree with that point of view. During the frenzy, as seen in December of last year, it is natural to have a surge in volume because traders throw caution out of the window and invest using leverage. Additionally, during a roaring bull market, many newbies enter the markets to make a quick buck. A combination of these leads to a spike in volume. When prices fall, most newbies are stuck with their positions because they rarely use a stop loss. Many among them would have also purchased in a falling market, exhausting their purchasing power. The only option they see now is to hold until the market recovers. This portion of the volume will not return until a price reaches the December highs. Cautious traders also don’t venture out in a falling market because it is always better to trade in a market that is in a clear uptrend. Both these reasons combined have led to a fall in volume.   Though we do keep an eye on the volume, we should not get worried about this fact, because we analyze the price action and use it for our trading decisions. In our previous analysis, we had recommended booking profits on half positions around the $10,700 mark and trailing the rest because a breakout of the $11,400 to $12,200 resistance zone will complete an inverted head and shoulders pattern, which will be bullish for Bitcoin.  Currently, the bulls are attempting to break out of the descending channel and move towards the neckline of the inverted H&S pattern. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover. All of this indicates that the bulls have an upper hand right now. Hence, chances are that the price will continue to rise in the ascending channel. The BTC/USD pair will gain momentum above $12,200. However, as traders, we have to be ready for any turn of events. If prices fail to break out of $12,200, chances are the cryptocurrency will become range bound between $9,500 and $12,200 for the next few days. Therefore, traders should watch the price action at the $12,200 mark carefully and book profits if they find that Bitcoin is not able to break out of it. Ethereum is underperforming. For the past five days, it has been struggling to break out of the 20-day EMA. In our previous analysis, we had asked traders to raise their stops to breakeven on half position and hold the rest with a stop at $780.    If the ETH/USD pair breaks and sustains below the trendline of the ascending triangle pattern, it will be a bearish development, which can sink it to $780 levels. Therefore, traders can raise the stops on the complete position to breakeven, which should be around the $830 mark. The first sign of a positive move will be when the cryptocurrency breaks out of the 20-day EMA. But it will gain momentum only after it breaks out and sustains above $980.   Bitcoin Cash continues to trade inside the range between $1,150 and $1,355. The longer it trades within this range, stronger will be the breakout. Therefore, we shall look to buy the breakout of the range.        Traders can buy the breakout and close (UTC) above the $1,355 levels with a $1,125 stop loss. Though the pattern target of the breakout of the range is only $1,560, we believe that the BCH/USD pair will rally to $1,600 and after that to $1,800 levels. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price breaks down of the range.    The buyers seem to have abandoned Ripple because, for the past eight days, it has been trading inside the range of $0.85 to $0.98669.  If the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the range, it is likely to rally to $1.12 levels where it will face resistance from the 50-day SMA. Once above this level, a move to $1.23 is likely. On the other hand, a breakdown of the $0.85 levels can push the cryptocurrency down to the $0.72 levels. We are unsure of the direction of the next move, hence, have mentioned the result for both possibilities.         The bears continue to dominate the trading action in Stellar. It is currently at the $0.32 critical support. If this level breaks, it might fall towards the support line of the descending channel two. We anticipate it’ll face strong support between $0.20 to $0.22 levels.  On the contrary, if the bulls succeed in defending the $0.32 levels, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA are likely to offer a strong resistance on any pullback. We shall change our view to bullish if the XLM/USD pair sustains above the $0.48 levels.   Litecoin is one of the few coins that is trading above both the moving averages. This made us very bullish on it. However, we were proven wrong because this did not result in any up move. We had recommended traders to buy closer to $200 on Feb. 23 and in our previous analysis, we had suggested raising the stop to breakeven.  We did so because the 20-day EMA has been providing support for the past two days. If this level breaks, a fall to the 50-day SMA is likely. Also, both moving averages have flattened out, which points to a range bound action in the short-term. The bulls now have an uphill task as they will face resistance at the $220 levels from the downtrend line and $240. We shall turn marginally positive after the LTC/USD pair sustains above $220. Cardano has declined close to our target objective of 0.00002460. The price continues to trade below both the moving average and the downtrend line; this is a bearish sign.  We expect a small bounce from the 0.0000246 levels, but the bounce is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. We may turn positive on the ADA/BTC pair only after it breaks out of the 0.00004070 levels. We have been bullish on NEO because it broke out of the bearish descending triangle pattern on Feb. 26. Therefore, we had recommended to buy it at $126 levels with the stop at $105. However, the price has not moved according to our expectation.  The NEO/USD pair has turned down sharply from the overhead resistance at $140. If the price fails to find support at $120 levels, it is likely to fall to the next immediate support of $110. We believe this zone to offer strong support. Therefore, we have retained the stop loss at $105. Both the moving averages are flattening out, which suggests a range bound action for a few days. On the upside, the cryptocurrency will gain momentum only above $140. EOS continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle. If it breaks down from the triangle, a retest of the Feb. 06 lows is likely.     On the other hand, a breakout of the triangle will carry it towards the upper end of the range at $10.119. Inside the triangle, the price movement is likely to remain volatile. We shall wait for the prices to break out of the 50-day SMA before recommending any long positions in the EOS/USD pair.

2018-03-06 00:37:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple CEO Talks Liquidity And Regulation: Ultimately Governments Aren’t Going Away,"Cointelegraph Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, talks to Cointelegraph about why Ripple is regulation-friendly and how it’s addressing the problem of global liquidity Interview Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple — a US-based payment network and protocol company — spoke with Cointelegraph at the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco earlier this year about what problems Ripple can solve in the global marketplace, and the company’s approach to government regulation and traditional finance. Garlinghouse, a Harvard Business School graduate, previously worked at various positions at Yahoo!, including Senior Vice President, and AOL, where he was President of Consumer Applications. Garlinghouse has also served on the board of Ancestry.com, Tonic Health, and Animoto. Ripple, whose native currency is XRP, has partnered with over 100 companies and financial institutions to send money worldwide using Ripple’s Blockchain-based technology. Ripple’s price began a skyrocketing uptrend in mid-December 2017, peaking at almost $4 per coin on Jan. 4, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ripple’s December rise can be attributed in part to their multiple partnerships with traditional finance companies, as mentioned above. In addition, the South Korean crypto market played an important role in bringing XRP’s market capitalization past $100 bln in early January, the first altcoin to reach such numbers. When CoinMarketCap took major South Korean exchanges off its listings in early January 2018, XRP saw a drop of more than $20 bln in market cap.  Since the start of 2018, Ripple has announced several new partnerships with financial institutions around the world. On Feb. 7, Ripple reported a new partnership with China-based payment services provider Lian-Lian, and a week later, Ripple made public a new relationship with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority to pilot cross-border payment programs to banks. On Feb. 14, Western Union confirmed that it is beginning testing of Ripple’s Blockchain-based settlement system for transactions. With a market cap of $37 bln, Ripple is currently the second largest altcoin on CoinMarketCap, trading at an average of just under $1 to press time, down 4.67 percent on the day. CT: Taking into consideration Ripple’s large uptick in January, its subsequent dip, and the stream of partnership announcements, what are the factors you think are the most influential in Ripple’s meteoric rise over the past couple of months? BRAD: The first thing I’ll say is I think it’s very hard to know exactly what drives any specific market. I think at Ripple we have continually tried to focus on solving a real problem for real customers. I think there’s obviously a lot of hype in the Blockchain space broadly and I think at the end of the day, from a long-term point of view, the value of any digital asset will be determined by its utility. If you aren’t solving a real problem for real customers, you’re not going to drive velocity and activity in that digital asset. What you’ve seen time and time again, when I say time and time again I’m talking about all markets, not just crypto and Blockchain, [is the idea of solving a real problem]. If you are able to solve a real problem for real customers [then you’re valued]. Especially if it’s a very, very big problem. For Ripple, that global liquidity problem is measured in the trillions of dollars, I think that people are realizing that Ripple is gaining traction, we’re gaining engagement, we’re gaining more customers. So there’s been interest in that. There’s a lot of science experiments in the Blockchain space. I think we are still at that starting line of the Blockchain space, overall. But We [Ripple] are the only ones that have actually crossed the starting line. There’s a marathon ahead, and I think we have a long way to go. But it’s clear that Ripple has passed the starting line. And I think there are a lot of people who are still experimenting with trying to figure out their product market fit. 2017 has been a big year for regulation globally — ranging from crypto bans in China to crypto-friendly regulation in Japan — but the US has yet to come up with a solid regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technologies, and ICOs in particular.   In December of last year, the Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated the Fed’s 2014 position that they have no authority to regulate cryptocurrencies, explaining that the Fed does not differentiate between crypto and fiat currencies when supervising banks to make sure they are complying with US law. After the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) circulated a number of warnings to investors about the “risks” of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in 2017, the SEC and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) held a joint hearing on cryptocurrencies on Feb. 6 of this year.  In the hearing the regulators decided to work together to provide “smart” regulation for cryptocurrencies, encourage Blockchain development, and be more attentive to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), to make sure they comply with US securities law. Recently, on Feb. 16, the SEC suspended trading in three crypto-related companies for investor protection purposes. On Feb. 28, media reported that the SEC had undertaken a probe into 80 cryptocurrency-related companies, including Overstock.com and a crypto fund created by TechCrunch’s founder. In February 2018, US states Arizona, Wyoming, and Georgia all introduced crypto-centered bills related to taxation and securities law. CT: As Ripple is based in the US, what is your approach to dealing with regulation both within the country and internationally? BRAD: Two thoughts. One thing that is interesting for me at Ripple is that in some ways people viewed Ripple as the contrarian. We were from the beginning really looking at how we work with governments, how we work with banks. And I think some in the crypto community have been very much, “How do we destroy the government. How do we circumvent banks?” I think that has differentiated us and I think ultimately governments aren’t going away. In my lifetime, I don’t think that’s happening. I am proud to be able to call the Bank of England a paid customer of Ripple’s. We believe absolutely there should be thoughtful regulation in crypto, in Blockchain. When we engage with customers, we are not changing the existing regulatory framework, meaning if, for example, the Bank of X has an account, you have to KYC – know your customer – you have to do the KYC check. If the Bank of X is using Ripple’s technology, you’re still doing your KYC check, you’re still doing your AML [anti-money laundering] check, you still need OFAC compliance, etc. When we talk to regulators, we explain how what Ripple is doing is not circumventing their regulatory frameworks, and they get very comfortable very quickly like, “Oh! I get it. Ok, we get it. If it’s a better product at lower price, we’re happy about that.” CT: Thank you so much, we really appreciate it.

2018-03-07 02:24:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 06","Cointelegraph The latest technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff believes that Bitcoin’s value will drop to $100 in a decade. He stated that increased regulation is one of the aspects that will bring down the value of Bitcoin. We, on the other hand, have an opinion that in a decade, the cryptocurrencies will have much more use cases and that it will increase their demand, propelling prices higher. Bitcoin’s entrepreneurs have taken up the task of rebuilding the Puerto Rico economy that has been hit by natural disaster, and a shortage of funds. This is a new experiment, and in case it succeeds, it will be implemented at many other places. Additionally, increased involvement of large companies with the crypto world shows their growing acceptance, which is a bullish sign. We had been expecting Bitcoin to break out of the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern and move towards the target objective of $13,000. But the bears strongly defended the $12,200 levels.  Yesterday, March 5, the BTC/USD pair reached a high of $11,934.08 but could not break out of the overhead resistance. Currently, the cryptocurrency is pulling back and is likely to find support at the trendline of the ascending channel at $11,100. If this support breaks, the next support lies at the 20-day EMA and below that at the 50-day SMA.   Therefore, traders can raise their stops to $11,000 on the remaining half-position. Once the price sustains below the channel, we expect it to stay range bound between $9,500 and $12,200. We had recommended traders to raise their stops on Ethereum to $830 in our previous analysis, which was hit today, March 6. The bulls have failed to break out of the 20-day EMA for the past nine days.  As the price is below both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA and is turning down from the resistance line of the descending channel, the bears have an upper hand.   Now, chances are that the bears will push the ETH/USD pair towards the $780 levels. If this level breaks, the next support is at $723. We had recommended buying Bitcoin Cash on a breakout above the range, however, the bulls could not push prices above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance.         Now, the bears are likely to push prices to the lower end of the range at $1,150. If the BCH/USD pair breaks below this support, it is likely to fall to the pattern target of $950. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $1,355.    In the previous analysis, we were unsure about Ripple’s price action. Yesterday, March 05, the price broke out of the overhead resistance, but it could not clear the 50-day SMA.  Prices turned down sharply, and the XRP/USD pair is now likely to continue trading in the range once again. If the bears push prices back below the $0.85 level, it can extend its fall to $0.72. We don’t find any trade setups on it at the moment.         Stellar continues to trade in the range because the bears were not able to break down below the $0.32 levels.  On the upside, the XLM/USD pair is facing resistance from the 20-day EMA. If it breaks down of $0.32, we might observe a fall to the support line of the descending channel at $0.22. The bulls will continue to face resistance from the 20-day EMA, the 50-day SMA and the upper end of the range.   Though Litecoin continues to trade above the 20-day EMA, it has lost its momentum. Both moving averages have flattened out, which points to a range bound action in the next few days. We recommend traders to retain the stop loss at $200, at breakeven.  Yesterday, March 05, the bulls attempted to break out of the downtrend line, yet, they could not sustain above the line. The LTC/USD pair is likely to correct towards the 50-day SMA. If this level breaks, a move towards $175 is also possible, where we expect strong buying to emerge. We should turn bullish if the cryptocurrency sustains above $225. Cardano has been holding above the critical support level of 0.00002460 for the past four days, but a lack of buying at the support level shows that the bulls are not interested in buying even at these levels.    If the price breaks down of 0.00002460, it can slide to 0.00001690 levels. On the upside, the ADA/BTC pair will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. We need to wait for buying to emerge before recommending a trade on it. We expected the $108 levels to provide strong support but we were proven wrong, and NEO broke below our suggested stop loss of $105.  The NEO/USD pair is now likely to fall to $93.5 levels. The zone between $86 to $93.5 might offer strong support. If it breaks, the cryptocurrency will become negative. On the other hand, the price will become positive on a sustained move above $140. EOS has broken down of the symmetrical triangle, which is a bearish development. Currently, the price is holding at the horizontal support of $7.5.  If this level also breaks, a retest of the Feb. 6 lows is likely. On the upside, the bulls will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. We shall turn bullish when the EOS/USD pair breaks out of $10.1190 levels. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-03-07 15:35:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Consortium Of 61 Japanese Banks To Release Instant Mobile Payment App Powered By Ripple,"Cointelegraph The 61-bank Japanese Bank Consortium has partnered with Ripple to release an instant domestic money transferring app this fall. News The Japanese Bank Consortium will release an instant domestic payments mobile app, “MoneyTap,” using Ripple’s technology in the fall of 2018, Ripple’s blog reported yesterday, March 6. The 61-bank consortium, led by SBI Ripple Asia, is representative of more than 80 percent of all of Japan’s banking assets, according to Ripple. Takashi Okita, CEO of SBI Ripple Asia, said in Ripple’s blog post: “Together with the trust, reliability and reach of the bank consortium, we can remove friction from payments and create a faster, safer, and more efficient domestic payments experience for our customers.” Three of the banks in the consortium, SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank, will begin using the app this coming fall, while the rest of the banks will join in gradually. MoneyTap will allow users to make purchases 24 hours a day, every day of the week. Ripple has long focused on building relationships with banks to use its payment technologies. In February, Ripple announced two new financial service partnerships; one with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority for use of its cross-border payment technology for banks within the country and another with Western Union, who is testing Ripple’s Blockchain-based settlement system for transactions. This month, a South Korean bank also announced that it planned on using Ripple’s cross-border payment technologies for remittances, prompted by a Japanese-based test of Blockchain-based remittances involving Ripple and SBI Group.

2018-03-08 18:52:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Ripple’s New Global Head of Banking Talks About RippleNet, PSD2 and the Future of Payment","Cointelegraph Cointelegraph spoke with Marjan Delatinne, global head of banking at Ripple, about her experience, banking, and the future of global payment. Interview Since January 2018 Ripple has a new global head of banking. Marjan Delatinne joined the company in 2017 after having spent ten years at SWIFT as business director commercializing different banking solutions including Global Payments Innovation (GPI). Part of the Women in Fintech Power list 2017, Delatinne has shown great ability in developing business strategies for innovative initiatives during her career. Cointelegraph had an opportunity to meet Delatinne in Frankfurt am Main at the Crypto Assets Conference and talk about her experience in sales leadership and banking, about RippleNet - global networks of banks and payment providers - and about her thoughts on the future of global payment. Cointelegraph: Thank you for joining us. Could you please tell us what excited you in the first place about Ripple when you became its part in 2017? MD: The vision of Ripple. I was very much impressed by the Internet of Value, which is making money moves instantly by analogy with the data that are exchanging over the Internet. I was working for SWIFT in the past, and correspondent banking is a core business of SWIFT. There are a lot of pain points and problems - and I want to change it. It sounds childish, but I want to make our world a better place. CT:  You studied psychology. How do you apply it to your work? MD: I studied psychology but business as well. I think psychology is everywhere. What I learned in my study of psychology is how to make you closer to your customers. It is not necessary to manipulate your customers but it is important to understand their needs better. You move on your business and psychological background helps you to build relationships and effectively interact with your clients and gain their trust. CT: Could you tell us about RippleNet? How could Ripple solve payment problems by using it? MD: I think this is a very good question. RippleNet enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking and message each other in real time to confirm payment details prior to initiating the transaction and to confirm delivery once it settles. If you are a part of RippleNet, you can send details and complete transactions in a matter of seconds, minimize liquidity costs and improve your customer’s experience. CT: A lot of banks have already joined RippleNet. How does it work – the adoption of RippleNet by global financial institutions? MD: We have more than a hundred banks and payment service providers. They are not all on the same level of maturity in terms of adoption. Some institutions are much more advanced because they joined us before others. When you join Ripple, you follow our business rulebook or network agreement, which ensures the consistency of the usage of the network for all participants. That's very important for the banks because they use this kind of rulebook as the first step. We do have quite valuable payment transactions exchanging over our network and this is reassures and gives confidence to the banks with which we are cooperating. CT: How do you attract new partners? What are the key challenges in communication with traditional banking institutes? MD: It takes time to attract new partners, especially big organizations. They have more complex legacy systems and if they invest, they have to be sure that their investment is bringing a return. But we see a significant change in terms of the way the banks are talking to Ripple. The trust that now has been built around Ripple and the fact that a lot of big players are already in our network - for example, Bank of America - make our new partners more confident that Ripple is working. CT: How do you deal with fake news and disinformation about Ripple? MD: There is some confusion around what Ripple is and what are the digital assets XRP that have been gifted to our company Ripple. The currency XRP was designed for cross-border payments transfer, and if you are talking about rumors, you should distinct entities. The best thing that we are doing, I should say, is that we are working very closely with regulators and we do have a very stringent compliance and regulatory affairs at Ripple. We are collaborating with regulators, but don't avoid them. We are educating our partners and working with them even closer to their projects. We cooperate with the Bank of England, and we have started a new project with Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority. So our approach is to continue this dialogue with regulators and ensure that they understand what we are doing with the cryptocurrency XRP. CT: What are the challenges you see for Ripple,  and how do you suggest solving them? MD: For us, any challenge is an opportunity to become better, because we are a new project. Creating a global network is not easy, it takes time. So you have to be very agile in terms of what are the core banks and this ecosystem that we are creating - it’s not only banks. At the same time, we are working with the payment service providers to connect them to the banks. We are discussing with corporations to see how they can better connect with their banks or payment service providers. This, of course, requires a lot of effort and agility in terms of approach. I think that is our priority in the coming weeks and hopefully coming years. CT: What do you think about the future of payments and fintech? How will it develop? MD: I think the future of payment, especially in the context of Europe, will be PSD2 (The EU's second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which came into force on January 13, 2018, aims to improve online payment protection, encourage payment services innovation, and make cross-border payments safer.  - Cointelegraph) and Open Banking that enables personal information to be shared between organizations, increase competition and create a better consumer experience. I think we will see a dramatic increase in the volume of payment and innovation of payments. Now the Internet of Value is becoming a reality - thanks to Blockchain technology. Traditional banking institutions must try to join or adapt to it, otherwise they can lose the game. I don't mean that cash will disappear - we will have cash and use it in the future. However, I think the nature of services that banks will offer consumers will be completely different. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2018-03-08 22:05:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 8","Cointelegraph A market overview with top 9 cryptocurrencies movement analysis. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. News continues to pound the cryptocurrency markets stifling attempts to a recovery. The news of the Binance exchange being hacked and the SEC has requested trading platforms dealing with digital assets to register as exchanges. Later, Binance reported that the irregular trades were reversed. They also had an interesting observation stating that the hackers had lost a few coins during their attempted hack. The possible SEC’s regulation is a much-debated issue with both sides having their own opinion about its pros and cons. But regulations have also proven positive for cryptocurrencies, attracting institutional money, which has stayed away from the markets until now. In another news, the Japanese regulators have come down heavily on Coincheck and six other exchanges. Bogged down by these news, most cryptocurrencies are struggling to hold on to their support levels. Let’s see if the downside is likely to extend or is a bottom around the corner. Bitcoin has failed to cross above the $12,200 on three occasions in the past month and a half. Therefore, this level assumes significance. The cryptocurrency will gain momentum only after it breaks out and sustains above $12,200.  In the last two days, the BTC/USD pair has broken down of the ascending channel and the two moving averages. Its next major support lies at $9,500. If this level breaks, a fall towards the $8,404 levels is possible, which is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the pullback from $6,075.04 to $12,172.43 levels. Both the moving averages have flattened out, therefore, if the $9,500 levels hold, a range bound trading can be expected. Intraday traders are likely to get an opportunity to play the small bounce at the $9,500 levels, but the swing traders should wait until the cryptocurrency shows sustained buying interest. Ethereum has corrected according to our expectation. The $723.48 level is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent pullback. Yesterday, March 7, the cryptocurrency fell to a low of $725 from where it bounced.    However, the bounce hasn’t been impressive. If the bulls don’t break out of the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel within the next few days, the ETH/USD pair is likely to fall to $654 and after that to $565 levels. The cryptocurrency will become positive when it breaks out of $980 levels. Though the bears broke below the support levels of $1,150, they have not been able to sink Bitcoin Cash to $950 levels, as we anticipated.         If the bulls are unable to push the BCH/USD pair back above $1,150, within the next couple of days, we might see a fall to $950. The cryptocurrency remains bearish as long as it trades below the moving averages.    Ripple is looking weak. Yesterday, March 7, the bulls recovered from below the $0.85 levels but could not build on the gains.  As a result, the price has again broken down of the $0.85 level. If the bears succeed in sustaining below this support, there’s a possibility of a fall towards the $0.7 levels. The lack of buying at lower levels points to a possibility of a further downside in the XRP/USD pair.         Stellar is in a downtrend and is not looking strong. It finds it difficult to bounce off the $0.32 critical support level. The bears do not allow it to even cross above the 20-day EMA.  Today, March 8, the bears have pushed the XLM/USD pair below $0.32. If the breakdown sustains, a fall towards the lower end of the descending channel at $0.22 is likely; where we expect buying to emerge. On the other hand, if the bulls defend the $0.32 levels, a range bound action between $0.32 to $0.47 should ensue.   After showing promise a few days back, Litecoin has become negative. We expected it to fall towards the 50-day SMA and that is what happened.  The LTC/USD pair has formed a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC) below $185. This gives a pattern target of $115 on the downside, though, we can expect some support at $160 and $140. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $215. Cardano is in a firm bear grip. Yesterday, March 7, the price broke down of the critical support level of 0.00002460. The selling has continued today and prices are sustaining below the support level. This is a bearish sign.    Now, there is no major support level on the charts, and a fall to 0.00001690 levels is likely. The first sign of a change in trend will be when the ADA/BTC pair breaks out of the downtrend line. Until then, bears have an upper hand. March 7, NEO fell to a low of $88.6, where buying emerged. The zone between $86 and $93 is important for the bulls.  If they fail to hold this support zone, the NEO/USD pair will slump towards the February 6 lows of $63.62. The cryptocurrency will become positive once it breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line 2.      In our previous analysis, we had forecast EOS to retest the February 6 lows, and that is what happened.  If the bulls fail to hold the $5.97 levels, the next support lies way lower at $3. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the EOS/USD pair climbs and sustains above $8 levels. Until then, it remains in a downtrend. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-03-10 19:39:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 10","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Wall Street strategist Thomas Lee has formulated a new contrarian index, called the Bitcoin Misery Index, BMI, which can be helpful for traders. Lee is bullish on Bitcoin and has retained a year-end target of $25,000, which results in a gain of more than 160 percent from the current levels. We believe it’s better to buy only after the cryptocurrencies stop falling because in a bear market people dump their holdings at ridiculous prices. So, let’s check if any of the digital currencies has formed a bottom. Bitcoin broke below the critical support of $9,500, yesterday, March 09, and hit an intraday low of $9,000.02, which is just below the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent pullback from $6,075.04 to $12,172.43.  The bulls bought the dip and pushed prices back above $9,500. The BTC/USD pair is still not out of the woods because it is still trading inside the descending channel. If the bulls sustain above the $9,500 levels, a range bound action is likely to ensue where we can expect the bulls and the bears to battle it out between $9,500 and $12,200 levels. On the contrary, if the bears again break below yesterday’s low of $9,000.02, the price might fall towards 61.8 percent of the $8,404 retracement level. We would like to see clarity and a support level holding before suggesting any trades. Yesterday, Ethereum fell according to our expectation to $637.63, but currently, the bulls are attempting a pullback.    The ETH/USD pair is currently in a downtrend as the price is trading inside the descending channel and below both the moving averages. Any rebound from the current levels is likely to face selling pressure at one of these resistance zones. It is bears’ advantage, until the bulls break out and sustain above these two overhead resistances. We have been expecting Bitcoin Cash to correct to $950 levels since our previous two analyses, but the bulls have held on to the $1,000 levels. On March 9, the price rebounded from $989.8418.          Within the next couple of days, if the bulls fail to sustain above $1,150, chances are that the bears will attempt to sink the BCH/USD pair towards the next support of $854. We will change our bearish view once the cryptocurrency rallies above $1,400.    We believe that Ripple is forming a large range. Yesterday, March 09, prices fell close to a lower end of the possible range.  On the downside, the level between $0.56270 and $0.695 is likely to act as strong support. This zone will hold unless there is news that might influence the market. Traders can buy the dip in the XRP/USD pair towards the $0.60 levels. It is best to wait for prices to stabilize for four hours and then buy on the way up, rather than buy on the way down. The stops can be placed at $0.55. The target is $1.22. This might turn out to be a roller coaster ride because trading inside the anticipated range will be volatile.         Stellar has broken below the $0.32 critical support, but it has not slumped as we had expected.  Right now the bulls are defending the $0.3 levels, but any pullback will face resistance at $0.32 and the 20-day EMA. If the bulls fail to sustain above $0.32, the XLM/USD pair can slide towards the lower end of the descending channel at $0.22 We should buy the cryptocurrency if it sustains above the $0.32 levels for a couple of days.   Litecoin broke and closed below the descending triangle on March 08, but the bulls quickly pushed the price back above $185 on March 09.  In case the bulls fail to sustain above $185, chances are that the LTC/USD pair will fall to $160 and then to $140 levels. As both moving averages have flattened out, we might see range-bound trading for a few days. Once we get the levels of the range, we may attempt to trade it. Cardano isn’t looking strong. For the past two days, it has sustained below 0.00002460. The next support lies way lower at 0.00001690.    At the moment, the bulls and the bears are in a state of equilibrium. The intraday ranges have shrunk for the past two days. We may see a few days of small ranges; after that, we expect a large range day. It is still difficult to forecast whether the large range day will be on the upside or the downside. We remain bearish on the ADA/BTC pair as long as it trades below the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. NEO has been under pressure from the bears, who are trying to break below the critical support zone of $86 to $93.  Yesterday, March 09, the NEO/USD pair fell to an intraday low of $78.92, but it closed above the support of $86.143. If the bulls fail to break above $93.5 levels, the bears will be back in action. On the downside, the next support is the February 06 lows of $63.62. We may change our bearish view after the price sustains above the downtrend line.      Yesterday, EOS fell below the $5.7917 critical level, but it recovered and ended the day above the support level. Nevertheless, if the bulls fail to carry prices towards the $8 levels, there might be a breakdown.  On the downside, the next support is only at $3.65 levels. However, if the bulls hold the $5.97 levels, the EOS/USD pair is likely to become range bound. We might start trading in the range once we have confirmation that the $5.97 level is holding.

2018-03-13 00:54:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 12","Cointelegraph Don’t miss the latest trading suggestions. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. By early February, Bitcoin had plunged about 68 percent from its lifetime highs in mid-December. This fall affected Bitcoin’s popularity, as measured by the number of people searching for it on Google. In the first half of March, Google Trends shows that Bitcoin searches have fallen to their lowest levels since October of last year. It isn’t necessarily a bad thing for the leading cryptocurrency. This shows that the euphoric phase has ended and some investors have fled the market. Now, only the most interested participants who have a greater conviction in the cryptocurrencies remain.   When prices don’t sustain below support levels on negative news, it is a sign that the bears are losing their grip. The early stages of a bull phase always cause worries. As and when prices recover, the ‘speculators’ will jump right back in. Let’s see if we find any buy setups for the top coins. The bears were unable to take advantage of the breakdown below $9,500 levels on Bitcoin on March 10. Prices quickly recovered on the next day, March 11, which shows strong buying support at lower levels.  Currently, the  BTC/USD pair is trading at a critical level. The level between $10,000 to $10,300 has resistances from the moving averages and the resistance line of the descending channel. Once the price breaks out and sustains above $10,300 for four hours, it can be purchased with a stop loss of $8,700. The first target objective is a rally to $12,150 from where the cryptocurrency has returned on three previous occasions. If prices break out of this resistance, Bitcoin will start a new uptrend. $654.02 has proven to be strong support on Ethereum. For the past three days, prices are trading inside a tight range of $745 to $654.  If the bulls break out of this tight range, the ETH/USD pair might rally to the $800 levels where it will face resistance from the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. Once these two resistances are crossed, the next resistance will be at $900 from 50-day SMA. The cryptocurrency doesn’t offer a good risk to reward ratio to the swing traders, however, the intraday traders can buy once prices break out of the resistances for a quick profit. In case of a breakdown of the range, a fall to $565 is likely. Bitcoin Cash has held the $1,000 levels for the past three days. Yesterday, March 11, prices broke out of the $1,150 overhead resistance, but the bulls have failed to build on this move.          Right now, the BCH/USD pair is facing resistance at the downtrend line. Just above lies the 20-day EMA. The bears will defend the $1,150 to $1,200 zone. Once above it, we might see a move to $1,355, which is major resistance. On the other hand, if the $1,000 level breaks down, the cryptocurrency can slide to $854. Our buy call on Ripple did not trigger because it has held above the $0.73 levels for the past three days.  We expect the XRP/USD pair to remain range bound for a few days. If the sentiment in the crypto industry improves, a rally to the upper end of the range at $1.22 is possible. Traders can buy on a breakout of $0.85 and keep a stop loss of $0.72. This is a risky trade, hence, please trade with only 50 percent of your usual position size. If the bears break below $0.73, Ripple can fall to $0.695 and then to $0.5627.         The price action in Stellar has been sluggish. The bears have not been able to take advantage of the breakdown below $0.32 levels. While we have been expecting a drop to $0.22 levels, the bulls have successfully defended the $0.25 levels.  Though the bulls are buying at the lows, they have not been able to push prices above $0.32. We shall suggest a long trade on the XLM/USD pair once prices sustain above $0.32 levels for a couple of days.    Litecoin is also trading in a tight range for the past four days. As the price has reached the apex of the descending triangle pattern, the bearish setup is not valid anymore.  If the bulls break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, we can expect the LTC/USD pair to start moving towards $250 levels. Therefore, we recommend buying Litecoin on a close (UTC) above $200. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $165. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the present levels and breaks below $180 once again, a decline to $160 can be expected. Cardano continues to trade in a small range as forecast in the previous analysis. As both the bulls and the bears are in a state of equilibrium, there is no trade setup.    One of the parties will exert their dominance within the next few days with a large range move. We should wait for it and then recommend a position. At the moment, any up move is likely to face resistance at 0.0000246. Above this, the next resistance will be from the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, which are at about the same level of 0.0000275. Once the ADA/BTC pair breaks out of this, it might start a new trend. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines. On the downside, the next support is at 0.00001690. NEO is looking weak as the bulls have not been able to push prices above $93.5 level in the past four days. This shows lack of buying.  Now, if the NEO/USD pair breaks down of the $80 levels, it will complete the descending triangle pattern. Though the pattern targets are way lower, we need to take it one step at a time. The immediate support is the February 06 lows of $63.62. We will attempt a long trade if the cryptocurrency sustains above the $100 levels for a couple of days.      For the past four days, EOS is struggling to hold the support level. Failure of the bulls to bounce off strong support indicates weakness.  The bears will now try to break below the supports and push prices towards the $3.65 levels. A breakdown will invalidate our view of a range formation in the EOS/USD pair. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-03-13 20:09:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,R3 v. Ripple Lawsuit To Be Decided In NY As XRP Loses Its Appeal To CA Court,"Cointelegraph Blockchain developer Ripple has lost its opportunity to fight against R3 in its home state California. Now, the case is expected to be settled by a New York court. News Ripple Labs Inc., the company behind the Ripple settlement system, has lost its opportunity to hold the court hearing over a contested contract with its rival R3 in its home state, California, Bloomberg reported March 13. In September 2017, the R3 consortium filed a lawsuit in Delaware and New York against Ripple, claiming that the latter had violated a prior agreement between the two companies about the purchase of XRP digital currency. The contract included an option allowing R3 to buy up to 5 bln XRP tokens at a price of $0.0085 each at any time before the end of 2019. Ripple further filed a counterclaim in California, accusing its former partner of infringing on a number of commitments associated with the agreement. When the two companies began suing each other, the value of the contract in dispute was a little over $1 mln. However, after several months of court proceedings the price of XRP surged in value, significantly increasing the stakes as the 5 billion XRP in question are now worth about $3.85 bln. A San Francisco state appeals court denied Ripple’s petition to appeal the order that dismissed its lawsuit against R3. The procedure in San Francisco followed a verbal ruling made by a Delaware judge to dismiss R3’s own case in October 2017. The outcome of this legal battle now depends solely on the future decision of a New York court. As the San Francisco-based Ripple claimed, having to bring the case before a New York court would cause the company ""irreparable injury.""

2018-03-15 04:03:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 14","Cointelegraph The latest technical analysis on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Google has followed Facebook in banning cryptocurrency-related advertising. While this is definitely not good news for ICO campaigns that rely heavily on marketing, this is unlikely to hurt the prospects of the coins backed by strong technical fundamentals. It won’t influence the already existing coins, because those сryptocurrencies don’t need a marketing team. Bitcoin’s popularity, for instance, continues to grow even as the established players attempt to stifle its rise. According to Dennis O'Callahan, CBOE’s director for product development, 7,000 contracts of Bitcoin futures change hands on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) every day, which has prompted the CBOE to consider the possibility of offering additional cryptocurrencies for trading. Bitcoin failed to break out of the descending channel and the moving averages, hence, our suggested buy levels were not triggered.  The failure of the bulls to first break out of $12,172 and then hold the $9,500 levels is a negative sign. This shows that the bulls are losing strength. If the BTC/USD pair breaks down of $8,800, it can fall to $7,850 and below this, to the February 06 lows of $6,075.04. Currently, the bears have the upper hand. The trend will change only after the bulls break out of the moving averages and the channel. In the past four days, Ethereum failed to break out of the tight range of $745 to $654. Today, March 14, the bears are attempting to break down of the range.  If successful, the ETH/USD pair can decline to the next support level of $565.54. Below this, the next support lies at $500. The downtrend is intact as the price continues to trade below both moving averages and inside the descending channel. Unless the bulls engineer a quick turnaround, the cryptocurrency will continue plunging. Bitcoin Cash has been trading inside the range of $1,000 on the downside and $1,150 on the upside for the past six days. The bulls failed to sustain above the $1,150 levels on March 11 and March 12, which shows a lack of buying at higher levels.        Today, the bears will try to breakdown of the $1,000 levels. If this support breaks, the BCH/USD pair might fall to the next lower support of $854. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency breaks out and sustains above $1,200 levels. Ripple did not reach our suggested buy level of $0.85, hence, the trade was not initiated. Today, the price is likely to retest the next lower support of $0.695.    If the bulls fail to hold on to this, it can fall to the next support of $0.5627. We expect the bulls to strongly defend these two supports because if they break, the XRP/USD pair can sink to $0.23 levels. However, if the supports hold, we might see a few days of range bound action. The next few days are critical for Ripple. Stellar is under a firm bear grip. The bulls have not been able to reclaim the $0.32 levels, which shows weakness.  With most cryptocurrencies falling, we expect the XLM/USD pair to also follow suit. The next support on the downside is $0.22, below which a fall to the support line of the descending channel is possible. Our bearish view will be negated in the short-term if the price breaks out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. Until then, all attempts to rally will face selling at the resistance levels.    Litecoin broke below the $180 levels yesterday, March 13. Today, March 14, it has continued its journey southwards.    If the price breaks down of $168, a slide to $160 and after that to $141 is plausible. The LTC/USD pair will become positive in the short-term if the bulls break out and sustain above $200 for four hours. As both moving averages have flattened out, we can expect a range bound action in the cryptocurrency once the decline ends. At least Cardano is not falling like the other cryptocurrencies. It is trying to break out of the overhead resistance at 0.0000246, though there’s lack of conviction.  Unless the ADA/BTC pair breaks out with force, it will again turn down from the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. We anticipate a few more days of small range days until the sentiment improves in the crypto world. NEO has completed a bearish descending triangle pattern with a breakdown of the $86 levels. The bulls will try to hold the next support level of $63.62, but if they fail, a slide to $49 is likely.    The bearish targets on the NEO/USD pair will be invalidated if the price breaks out and sustains above $94 levels.      EOS is strong compared to the other cryptocurrencies because it has not broken down of its immediate support of $5.166. If this level holds, we can expect a range formation that can be traded.  However, if the bears force a breakdown of the supports, the EOS/USD pair can sink to the next support level of $3.65. We will have a better picture in a couple of days. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Fundstrat's Thomas Lee believes that Bitcoin mining is an unprofitable venture at current prices. A model developed by his data science team has pegged the breakeven price at $8,038. If prices fall further, the miners will start to lose money on their operations. Shone Anstey, co-founder and president of Blockchain Intelligence Group opines that this may force a few miners to stop their operations.   Technical analysts watch the 50-day MA and the 200-day MA closely to forecast the path of least resistance. A death cross, a situation where the short-term moving average falls below the long-term moving average, indicates weakness. Paul Day, a technical analyst and head of futures and options at Market Securities Dubai Ltd believes that if the cross occurs, Bitcoin can sink to $2,800. It is common to see wild price forecasts on the downside when Bitcoin is falling. We saw similar outrageous forecasts on the upside when the cryptocurrency was rising. Though we do keep those factors in mind, we should not be worried much by them. Let’s see what our analysis forecasts. Bitcoin fell to $8,066.61 levels on March 15. The bulls are trying to defend the $8,000 levels and pullback towards the $9,500 levels.  The BTC/USD pair remains in a downtrend as prices are trading inside the descending channel and below both moving averages. The 20-day EMA has broken below the 50-day SMA, which is another bearish move. If prices fail to sustain above the overhead resistance zone of $9,500 to $10,000, the cryptocurrency can fall to $7,850 and after that to the February 06 lows of $6,075.04. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls manage to sustain above the $10,000 levels. Ethereum extended its downtrend as it fell to $568.29 on March 15, close to the February 06 lows of $565.54. This is major support.  We expect the bulls to attempt a bounce from these levels. The pullback will face selling pressure at the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. If the bounce fails to gain strength, the next down leg in the ETH/USD pair will break below the $565.54 support and move lower to $500 and then to $430 levels. Aggressive traders can buy a very small position, about 30 percent of the usual position size at $630, if the level sustains for about four hours. The stop loss can be kept at $560. If the price fails to break out of $700, positions can be closed, else please trail the stops higher. Bitcoin Cash fell to $910.6798 levels on March 15. Currently, the bulls are attempting a pullback from the supports.        The downtrend line should act as the first level of resistance. Above this, the 20-day EMA and $1,150 will act as resistance. If the cryptocurrency turns down from these levels and breaks below $900, it can slide to $778.2021. The BCH/USD pair will become positive in the short term once the price sustains above $1,150.      Ripple found support at the $0.62681 levels on March 15. We believe that the support zone between $0.695 and $0.5627 will hold. The bulls are attempting to pull back above the March 15 high of $0.72685. Once this level is crossed, a move to the 20-day EMA is possible where the cryptocurrency will face strong selling pressure.  During the next decline, if the XRP/USD pair does not break below $0.695, we can expect it to trade in a large range. We may try to trade this, but as we don’t see any buy setup, hence, we don’t recommend any trade on it at the moment.         Stellar remains in a downtrend, and it continues to decline gradually. It is close to our first lower target of $0.22.  If the bulls fail to defend these levels, the XLM/USD pair can slide towards the support line of the descending channel. We remain bearish on the cryptocurrency until it stays below the 20-day EMA, the downtrend line and $0.32.   Litecoin is trying to pull back towards $186.823 levels, where we expect another bout of selling by the bears.  Both moving averages, the downtrend line and the horizontal line, all converge around $187 levels making it important resistance. If prices turn down from the resistance and break below $157.236, it might fall to $141. The LTC/USD pair will indicate strength if it can sustain above $187 levels for a day. We expected Cardano to trade in a range, but prices turned down from 0.00002482 levels on March 14 and are now on its way towards the next lower target of 0.00001690.  It continues to be in a strong bear grip as the cryptocurrency has not even touched the 20-day EMA for more than a month.   The ADA/BTC pair will become positive once prices break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. Until then, all attempts to recover will face selling at the resistance. The bulls are trying to hold the critical support level of $63.62 on NEO. We can expect a retest of the breakdown level at $86. If the bulls succeed in sustaining above this overhead resistance, it will indicate that the bears are losing strength.  If prices turn down from $86 levels, we anticipate the next down move to a breakdown of $63.62 and move towards the lower target objective of $49. We should wait for a confirmed buy setup to initiate a long position on the NEO/USD pair.      EOS has been declining gradually for the past few days. It fell to a low of $4.7484 on March 15. We can expect the bulls to attempt a pullback from the current levels, but the 20-day EMA has been acting as strong resistance since end-January of this year. If prices turn down once again from there, a fall to $3.26 is likely.  If the EOS/USD pair sustains above the $7 levels, we can expect it to rally to the 50-day SMA and then to $10 levels. Currently, we don’t find any buy setups on the cryptocurrency. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Bitcoin continues to be pounded by negative news. Unconfirmed reports about Twitter following the footsteps of Facebook and Google in banning cryptocurrency ads pushed Bitcoin’s price below $8,000 on March 18. The focus will probably shift to the G20 summit, where cryptocurrencies are expected to be discussed. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which advises on and coordinates financial regulation in the G20, is unlikely to introduce new rules, but the news will still keep the markets on edge. While this news and events are keeping many investors at bay, Tom Lee, a managing partner at Fundstrat has a different opinion. He believes that Bitcoin can reach $91,000 by March 2020, if it repeats its past performance of rising from the ashes following sharp declines. Do we spot any buying opportunities? Let’s find out. Bitcoin is in a downtrend, as it is trading inside the descending channel and below both moving averages. Though the path of least resistance is on the downside, we believe that the price action points to a possible change in trend within the next few days.  For the past few days, the BTC/USD pair has been clinging to the resistance line of the descending channel, which shows that the bears are losing momentum. Judging by the two previous years, prices rebound sharply after the RSI enters the oversold territory. Therefore, we should look for an entry opportunity if the cryptocurrency plunges because of the panic selling. Traders can also enter long positions if Bitcoin breaks out of the channel and both moving averages. We like the way the cryptocurrency has held above the February 06 lows despite the negative news. This gives us confidence that a bottom is around the corner, but we would recommend buying only after some confirmation on the charts. In case of any fall, the next major support is $6,075.04. Ethereum broke below the critical support of $565.54 and plunged to a low of $452.32 on March 18. This shows that the bears have an upper hand. The fall has pushed the RSI into the oversold territory, but we still don’t have any confirmation that the downtrend has ended.  Right now, the ETH/USD pair is falling inside another descending channel (marked as 2 on the chart). Any attempt by the bulls to pullback will face strong resistance at the 20-day EMA, the resistance line of the larger descending channel and the 50-day SMA. On the downside, if the cryptocurrency breaks below $450, it can fall to the next support zone of $385 to $413. Bitcoin Cash dipped below $900 levels in intraday trading on March 18 but closed well above it. The $900 level has proven to be strong support.        On the upside, the downtrend line is major resistance. Above this, there are a slew of resistances between the $1,100 to $1,225 levels. We don’t have any buy setups on the BCH/USD pair at the moment. Therefore, we do not recommend any trade on it.      Ripple dipped below the critical support of $0.56270 on March 18, but buying at lower levels again pushed prices above the support line.  We expect the XRP/USD pair to trade between $0.56 to $1.22961 for a few days. As this is a large range and can be traded, we suggest buying at $0.71 with a stop loss of $0.53. Our target objective is a move to $1.22 levels, but it won’t happen in a hurry. Any up move will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. We shouldn’t be fixated on the target. We need to liquidate the position if the price struggles at any specific level.         Stellar is in a downtrend. It continues to trade below both moving averages and the downtrend line. It has been falling inside a descending channel since the first week of this year. As long as it remains inside the descending channel, it is vulnerable to selling pressure.  It fell below our anticipated support of $0.22. At the moment, the XLM/USD pair is close to the downtrend line, which has strong resistance. If this level is crossed, the next critical zone will be between $0.284 and $0.32. We suggest waiting for the trend to change before making any trades.   Litecoin fell to $144.544 on March 18, very close to our forecast level of $141. It is pulling back towards the downtrend line, which will act as resistance.  The LTC/USD pair is not showing any trend formation. The $176 to $186 area will act as stiff overhead resistance. The moving averages are flattening out, criss crossing each other, which points to a range bound trading for the next few weeks. We should not risk buying, until we see a specific trend forming. Cardano fell to 0.00001673 on March 18, just below our target of 0.00001690. The RSI is deep in the oversold territory; therefore, a pullback is likely.    Any attempt to rally will face resistance at the downtrend line, which has not been crossed since mid-January of this year. The ADA/BTC pair will attract buyers once it sustains above 0.000025 levels. We recommend remaining on the sidelines until the trend turns up. NEO has been falling from $144.48 (February 28) to $49.04 (March 18). That is a 66 percent fall within a very short span of time. The RSI is also close to the oversold territory - this is why a pullback can’t be ruled out.  The $86 level will act as stiff resistance on any pullback. If the bulls fail to break out of the horizontal resistance and the 20-day EMA, we can expect a range bound action for the next few days. If the NEO/USD pair turns down from the resistance and sustains below $50 levels, we can expect further selling to push the cryptocurrency back to $30 levels. A breakout above $86 will be a bullish move; we might see a rally to $110 levels afterward.      We had been expecting a fall to $3.26 levels, but EOS turned up from $3.8723. It is also trying to correct the oversold nature of the RSI.  The bulls will face stiff resistance at $6 and then at $8 levels. The EOS/USD pair will gain strength once it trades above $8. If prices turn down from the 20-day EMA, the cryptocurrency can fall to $0.326 levels. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-03-21 21:52:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 21","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The G20 considers cryptocurrencies risky, said the head of Italy’s central bank, but the broad consensus is that they should not be banned. After days of negative news, this is a positive shift for the cryptomarket. Led by Bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies are trying to pull back from their recent lows. The plunge in cryptocurrencies from their December highs had scared off new wannabe cryptocurrency investors. Once the tide turns, we may see fresh money trickle back into the markets. A recent survey by Finder.com shows that only 8 percent of the Americans own cryptocurrencies and another 8 percent plan to buy it in the future. With about 92 percent of the population still untapped, the markets have a long way to go. There is still enough skepticism and fear due to the huge volatile moves in the digital currencies. However, if traders plan properly, the risks are way less than made out to be. Let’s watch the setups that are developing on the top coins. Bitcoin broke out of the descending channel on March 20, which is a bullish sign. It had broken out once earlier on March 02, but it could not sustain the higher levels. Within six days, the price was back inside the channel. Will the same thing repeat again?  Just above the resistance line of the descending channel are resistances from the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. We expect the bears to strongly defend this zone because once the price breaks out of this, the BTC/USD pair will rally to $12,172. The next dip towards the $8,800 levels should offer the traders a good entry opportunity. They should purchase 50 percent of the desired allocation around $8,800 with a stop loss of $7,600. The remainder of the position can be added once the cryptocurrency is clear of both moving averages. The target objective on the upside is a rally to $12,000. Ethereum is trying to break out of the descending channel (marked 2 on the chart) and the overhead horizontal resistance at $565.54. If successful, we’ll see a rally to the 20-day EMA at $650, which will most likely trigger bears selling.    Above the 20-day EMA, the resistance line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA are the other two significant resistance levels. Aggressive traders can buy if the price closes above $575 (in the UTC time frame). The initial stop loss can be placed at $500. If the cryptocurrency struggles to break out of $660, the positions can be closed. On the contrary, if the ETH/USD pair turns back below $565, it will become weak, and the price will experience a retest of the recent lows. Bitcoin Cash has broken out of the downtrend line and is currently trying to move above the 20-day EMA. There are a number of resistances between $1,100 to $1,200.  Currently, the cryptocurrency remains in a downtrend, as both moving averages are falling and the price is still below them. Once it sustains above $1,200, we can expect the BCH/USD pair to attract buyers and rally towards $1,600. We should wait for Bitcoin Cash to break out of the 50-day SMA before suggesting any trades. On the downside, $980 and $880 will act as strong support on declines.       In our previous analysis, we had recommended a long position for Ripple at $0.71, which got filled on March 19. The stop loss for the trade is $0.53, which is just below the low on March 18.  On March 20, the XRP/USD pair formed an inside day candlestick pattern. The range has shrunk again today, showing indecision between the bulls and the bears. If the consolidation of the past two days breaks out of $0.73, the pullback will gain strength. On the upside, the bears will pose a stiff challenge in the zone between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Once the price breaks out of the $0.9 levels, the cryptocurrency should rally to $1.1 and then to the upper end of the $1.2 range. We need to close the position if the price struggles to break out of any of the above-mentioned resistances. Stellar has pulled back from the lows of $0.2 to the 20-day EMA. It has broken out of the downtrend line meanwhile, which confirms that the negative momentum is weakening.  Still, the bears will try to defend the 20-day EMA. If the bulls purchase the subsequent dip around the $0.23 mark, it will offer the traders an opportunity to initiate long positions. We are suggesting an aggressive trade on the XLM/USD pair because we find that the 20-day EMA, the resistance line of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA have not offered a strong resistance previously. The position can be covered if the daily close (UTC) is below $0.18. On the upside, we can expect a rally to $0.35. If this level is crossed, a move to $0.47 can’t be ruled out. Litecoin looks strong as it has pulled back smartly from the lows of $144.544. It has broken out of the downtrend line, which is a positive sign. The current recovery might face a stiff resistance between the 20-day EMA and $187. We need to wait for the next dip to initiate long positions.  We find a large symmetrical triangle formation on the LTC/USD pair, which will break out above $205. Though the target objective is way higher, we can trade it for an up move to $240 and after that to $300. Two possibilities are developing. Either buy on a dip towards $165 with a $142 stop loss or wait for a breakout above $205 to enter long positions with a stop loss at $180. Cardano has broken out of the downtrend line for the first time since January this year. This is a major development as it shows that the trend is changing.    Right now, the ADA/BTC pair is facing resistance at 0.00002460. Once the bulls clear this resistance, a move to 0.000035 is possible. Therefore, we suggest long positions if the price sustains at 0.000025 levels for four hours. The stop loss can be kept at 0.000016. NEO has pulled back sharply from its recent lows of $49.04. This shows that the markets have rejected the breakdown and the lower levels. We expect a stiff resistance at the $86 levels.  If the NEO/USD pair finds support at the $65 mark during the next dip, it will signal a bottom formation and can be purchased with a stop below $48. But if the price continues to march higher, then $90 is a good level to enter long positions with an initial stop loss of $70, which can be raised later. Our first target objective is a move to $115, where we anticipate selling. If NEO breaks out of $120, the momentum should pick up and push prices towards $140 levels.      EOS has risen sharply from its lows of $3.8723. For the past two days, it is facing selling at the 20-day EMA, but it has not given up much ground, which is a positive indication.  If the EOS/USD pair rallies above $6.3, it should move up to the resistance line of the descending channel. Prices have turned down from the channel line on two previous occasions, hence, this will act as a stiff resistance. At the moment, we don’t have an attractive risk to reward ratio, that’s why we don’t recommend making any trades on it. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2018-03-23 23:25:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 23","Cointelegraph The latest technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The pullback in cryptocurrencies could not sustain as fears of a clampdown by the regulators again sent them crashing down. The latest news came from the Japan Financial Services Agency, as it issued a warning for Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, for operating in Japan without a license. Binance, which was founded in Hong Kong said that it is “in conversation” with the FSA to seek a license. Additionally, it is examining the possibility of opening an office in Malta, according to the founder Zhao Changpeng. Such obstacles are to be expected in any new asset class, more so, if it has a reputation of being preferred by tax hoarders and money launderers. However, for every avenue that closes, another new one opens. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay and grow in value in the future. So, let’s see if we find any buying opportunities. We had suggested traders buying 50 percent of the desired allocation if Bitcoin dips to $8,800. The levels were reached today, March 23, and the trade is active. The initial stop loss is $7,600, which should be trailed higher once the price breaks out of $9,300.  For the past two days, the bulls have managed to keep prices above the descending channel, which is a positive sign. The BTC/USD pair will gain momentum once it sustains above the 50-day SMA and $10,000. Once these two levels are crossed, a rally to $12,172 is likely. On the other hand, if prices fall into the descending channel and break below the March 18 lows of $7,715, a retest of the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 is possible. On March 19, though the intraday high was $590.11, the closing (UTC) was at $558.78. Our proposed long positions were not filled because Ethereum could not close above $575.    Currently, the bulls are trying to push prices back above the descending channel. If successful, we can expect a move to the 20-day EMA at $641. On the contrary, if the bears push prices back into the channel, a retest of the March 18th lows of $452.32 might take place. We don’t find any setup that has a good risk to reward ratio, hence, we don’t recommend a trade on the ETH/USD pair at the moment. Bitcoin Cash could not break out of the 20-day EMA but is holding above the downtrend line, which is a positive sign.  If the BCH/USD pair fails to hold the $980 levels, it can slide to $940 and then to the March 18th lows of $884.7951. On the upside, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA will act as a strong resistance. Once the price sustains above $1,200, it will indicate the start of a new trend. Until then, we shall remain on the sidelines.       We went long on Ripple at $0.71, on March 19. Our suggested stop loss is $0.52, just below the March 18th lows. We took this trade because we anticipated a range bound action on the cryptocurrency.  However, for the past four days, the XRP/USD pair has been correcting back towards the critical support of $0.5627. If the bulls are unable to recover prices within a day or two, a breakdown of the March 18th lows is possible. If the $0.5375 level breaks, the next support is only at $0.22. On the upside, the cryptocurrency will pick up momentum above $0.75. In our previous analysis, we had suggested long positions in Stellar if the bulls buy the dip at $0.23. Currently, the price is struggling to hold above the downtrend line.  If prices dip back below the downtrend line, a retest of the $0.2 level is possible. If this level breaks, the next support is way lower at the support line of the descending channel. Therefore, we suggest buying the XLM/USD pair on a close (UTC) at $0.25, which will confirm a successful retest of the downtrend line. The target objective on the upside is $0.32 followed by a move to $0.35. The initial stop loss can be kept at $0.19, on a closing basis (UTC), which can subsequently be trailed higher. We had recommended buying Litecoin on dips to $165. Traders who have initiated long positions today should keep the stop loss at $142.  The LTC/USD pair turned down from the 20-day EMA on March 21 and broke below the downtrend line. Unless the bulls recover prices quickly, the cryptocurrency will retest the March 18th lows. If the retest fails, a slide to $128 will be on the cards. The first sign of strength will be when the price sustains above $180. Please use only 50 percent of the usual position size. If you have purchased the normal size, please sell half at the current levels. Let’s keep our risk to the minimum. Cardano did not trigger our buy levels of 0.000025. It turned down from 0.00002449 on March 21. We expect it to find buying support above the downtrend line, around the 0.00002 mark.  We continue to be bullish on the ADA/BTC pair, providing it breaks out and closes (UTC) above 0.000025. The target objective is 0.000035 and the stop loss can be kept just below the recent lows. Critical supports on the downside are at 0.00002 and 0.00001690. In our previous analysis, we had recommended long positions in NEO if it holds the $65 mark. Right now, we don’t see any significant buying support at this level. If the support breaks, a fall to the March 18th lows of $49.04 is likely.  Therefore, traders should wait for a bounce and initiate long positions after the NEO/USD pair breaks out $82. The stop loss can be kept just below the recent lows, and the target objective is a rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle at $110.   Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency continues to slide below $65 levels.    EOS has risen close to the resistance line of the descending channel, which is a major hurdle to cross because the price has turned down from this line on two previous occasions.  For the past two days, the EOS/USD pair has been trading close to the resistance line, but to its credit, it has not given up much ground. It continues to trade above the 20-day EMA; it is a positive sign. A breakout and close (UTC) above the resistance line of the channel and the 50-day SMA gives a pattern target of $11.5. Aggressive traders can initiate a long position around $8 with a stop loss of $6. This is a risky trade because the cryptocurrency has resistances at $8.6 and $10. Therefore, traders should close the position if they find that one of the above-mentioned levels is proving difficult to cross. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2018-03-24 17:15:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Santander: We’ll Launch Int’l Payment App With Ripple This Spring If No One Beats Us To It,"Cointelegraph Santander has announced the upcoming launch of an international money transferring mobile app that will use Ripple’s technology. News Banking group Santander will be partnering with Ripple to release an international money transfer app using Ripple’s Blockchain xCurrent and RippleNet platforms, Business Insider reports today, March 24. When speaking about the upcoming app release at the International Fintech conference in London yesterday, March 23, Nathan Bostock, the UK CEO of Santander said: “This spring, if not [sic] one beats us to it, we will be the first large retail bank to carry out cross-border payments at scale with Blockchain technology.” At the end of January of this year, Ana Botin, the CEO of Santander, had mentioned the app launch in the company’s 2017 earnings presentation, noting that it will be open to Spain, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Poland.  According to Business Insider, Santander had invested in Ripple in 2015 and 2016. The two companies tested an international payment app with test trials in 2016 that showed that Ripple’s technology concluded transfers in less than a day. The payment app will also be able to show an estimate of the cost of a money transfer. So far this year Ripple has partnered with MoneyGram to speed fiat settlements, a consortium of 61 Japanese banks for creating an instant domestic payments app, and a South Korean bank for “commercial” international remittances, among others.

2018-03-24 23:09:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Co-Founder Of Ripple, Stellar: Blockchain Needs To Be Decentralized To Be Successful","Cointelegraph Stellar’s CTO Jed McCaleb claims that decentralization is the only way for Blockchain networks to succeed in the long-term, compares with Internet. News Jed McCaleb, the co-founder of Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM), as well as the creator of the infamous Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange, claimed that cryptocurrency and its underlying technology, Blockchain, should remain decentralized in order to succeed in the future, CNBC reported Friday, March 23. In an interview on CNBC’s Fast Money, McCaleb said that the only other successful decentralized network he has ever seen is the Internet. In a fairly open critique of Ripple – a payment protocol company he co-founded in 2013, but has since left – McCaleb stated that the deployment of a centralized financial payment protocol in crypto would lead to “a system that is no better than SWIFT or PayPal.” He continued his Internet and Blockchain comparison, saying: ""The real vision is that you have a network, much like the internet, that anyone can participate in [...] That's the key thing to make these things successful."" Earlier this week, McCaleb explained his vision for a Blockchain-powered “universal payments network”, also noting he thinks all equity will be tokenized by the year of 2028. McCaleb is not the only high profile person making public comments on crypto and Blockchain this week. On March 22, Edward Snowden expressed concerns during an interview that the Bitcoin (BTC) Blockchain is “devastatingly public”, calling BTC’s public ledger its “long-lasting flaw”. Earlier this week on March 21, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and payment service Square, told mainstream media that he sees a single future currency emerging for the world and Internet, adding “I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin.” Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2018-03-26 23:22:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 26","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. During a bear market, fear grips the investors, resulting in a long liquidation. While some believe that the bubble in Bitcoin has burst, others believe that the current fall is only a correction, which will lead to higher prices later in the year. Founder and chairman of investment firm LDJ Capital, David Drake believes that Bitcoin will rally to $30,000 by the year-end. That is a whopping 262 percent return from the current levels. Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, believes that Bitcoin can replace the fiat currencies within a decade. A few positive voices in a sea of gloom is a welcome change. Let’s see if the short-term picture is improving or not. Though Bitcoin broke out of the descending channel on March 20, it could not cross above the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again threatening to dip back into the channel, which is a bearish development. Our long positions initiated at $8,800 are trading under a loss. As the setup looks negative, we suggest booking a loss on 50 percent of the open positions and holding the rest with the stops at $7,600.  The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $7,715, below which, a retest of the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 is possible. Our bearish view on the BTC/USD pair will be invalidated if prices breakout and sustain above the 50-day SMA. Ethereum is in a strong downtrend. It continues to trade inside the channel and below both the moving averages, which are falling sharply. The recovery attempt by the bulls failed at the $590 levels.    The final critical support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $452.32. Below this level, the ETH/USD pair can fall to $385. The RSI is deeply oversold, which shows that the selling has been overdone. We anticipate another pullback attempt within the next few days. The first sign of strength will be when the bulls sustain above $600. Until then, the bears will continue to sell on rallies. Bitcoin Cash has broken below the $1,000 levels after holding it for three days. The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows $884.7951.  If the BCH/USD pair breaks below this, it will retest the February 06 lows of $778.2021. Bears have the upper hand as they have not allowed the price to climb above the 20-day EMA since February 21. We should turn positive only after the cryptocurrency breaks out of the 50-day SMA.        Our anticipation of a range bound trading action on Ripple is proving to be wrong. Prices are falling sharply towards the lower end of the range at $0.56270. Our suggested long position at $0.71, on March 19 is deeply in the red. Our stop loss is at $0.52, just below the March 18 lows.  If the XRP/USD pair breaks below $0.5375, a fall to $0.22 is possible, because there is no support in between. The cryptocurrency will become positive only above $0.72. Stellar did not close above our buy trigger of $0.25, as recommended in the previous analysis. Therefore, we don’t have any position in it.  The XLM/USD pair is gradually falling towards the $0.2 levels, which is a critical support. If this support breaks, the cryptocurrency can slide to the support line of the descending channel at $0.1 levels. We’d better wait for prices to turn up before suggesting any long positions in it. Our long position in Litecoin recommended at $165 is under loss. Traders who have initiated long positions should keep the stop loss at $142.  The LTC/USD pair has again fallen below the downtrend line, which is a bearish sign. A critical support is the March 18 lows of $144.544. If this level breaks, the support line of the symmetrical triangle can provide support at $127, below which a retest of the February 02 lows of $107.102 will be on the cards. The virtual currency will turn bullish only after it breaks out of the $200 levels. Though Cardano broke out of the downtrend line on March 21, it could not break out of the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance at 0.00002460. Our buy levels of 0.000025 have not triggered and stand canceled.  The ADA/BTC pair will spend a few days in the range of 0.00001690 and 0.00002460. A breakdown below the supports will prove to be bearish while a breakout will carry prices higher. Therefore, we need to wait for a breakout and close above the overhead resistance before initiating any trade. NEO has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $65.  After the initial bounce from the lows of $49.04 on March 18, we had expected the bulls to strongly defend the $65 levels during the pullback. However, after failing to rise above $70 for the past three days, prices have now broken down of the support levels. Next, if $49.04 level breaks, the NEO/USD pair can slide to $31.15 levels. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls quickly reverse and sustain prices above $65.    We wanted to buy EOS once it broke out of the descending channel but that did not happen. After staying above the 20-day EMA for the past five days, prices have slipped this week.  The EOS/USD pair has some support at the $5.84 mark. Below that, it can slide to $5 levels. On the upside, even if the bulls manage to push prices above the 20-day EMA, they will again face a stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2018-03-28 19:42:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 28","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Following regulators around the world, technology giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter are now taking actions against initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies in terms of advertising. Will this dent the popularity of cryptocurrencies? Nope. Can this cause a short-term blip in the prices? Definitely. The popularity of the cryptocurrencies is based on the underlying technology and not on advertising. Also, Bitcoin and altcoins have faced lot more serious problems in the past and have emerged stronger. This time is not going to be any different. We consider these dips as an opportunity to get a “piece of the future” at a discount. Read on to see what we can buy today. We had previously indicated that the initial stop loss for Bitcoin was $7,600, however this has not triggered. Currently, there is a tussle between the bulls and the bears at the $8,000 mark.  The trend is down as prices are quoting below both moving averages. The 20-day EMA is falling and holds the key for the near-term price movement. If the bears break below the March 18 lows of $7,715, the BTC/USD pair will weaken further, inviting further selling. On the other hand, if the bulls push prices higher from the current levels, we may see a range develop. The 50-day SMA is flattening rather than falling, which points to a range bound action in a few days’ time. Important supports to watch on the downside are $7,850, $7,285 and $6,075. On the upside, the resistance levels to look for are $8,912 (the 20-day EMA) and $9,412.41 (the intraday high of March 21). Though the risk is high, we suggest holding the long positions with the stipulated stop loss. The traders can add to their positions once the cryptocurrency shows signs of bottoming out. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings on Ethereum are in the deeply oversold territory not seen since Dec. 2016. So, should the traders initiate long positions? No. In a downtrend, the RSI can remain in the oversold territory for a long time. However, traders should watch for a reversal in the price action because an oversold reading shows that the selling has been overdone.  On March 27, the ETH/USD pair broke below the March 18 lows of $452.32. Ideally, the selling should intensify and the cryptocurrency should fall to the next support of $385. If the markets reject the lower levels and the price starts to move back up, it will be the first indication that a bottom is in place. Once the price rallies above $600, it will indicate a double bottom formation. Therefore, we suggest waiting until Ethereum shows strength. Bitcoin Cash has retested the March 18 lows of $884.7951, as forecast in our previous analysis. The next support on the downside is a fall to the February 06 lows of $778.2021. If this level breaks, the slide can extend till $600 levels.  Any pullback to the upside will face selling at the 20-day EMA, which has acted as an important resistance on previous occasions. The flattening 50-day SMA points to a range bound action, but we should suggest a buy on the BCH/USD pair only after we get a confirmation of a bottom formation. We believe that $1,200 is a good level to enter long positions.        Ripple is holding on to the critical support of $0.56270 with the skin of its teeth. The current prices are far away from our recommended buy levels of $0.71. Our stop loss is at $0.52 and the cryptocurrency dipped to a low of $0.55703 on March 27.  If the bears sustain below $0.56720 for three days, a quick slide to $0.22 is possible because there is no major support in between. The XRP/USD pair will confirm a range bound trading action if it rallies above the $0.72 levels. Stellar has managed to stay above the March 17 close (UTC) of $0.20263635. This shows lack of selling at the current levels, but we are yet to see stable buying.  The XLM/USD pair will indicate a probable change in trend if it can close above the $0.27 mark. Until then, prices might remain in a tight range. A break of the $0.2 levels will be a bearish development and can sink prices to $0.1 levels. Therefore, we are not suggesting a long position at the current levels. The long position in Litecoin recommended at $165 was closed when it hit its stop loss at $142 on March 27.  The LTC/USD pair now has support at the trendline of the symmetrical triangle at $128. If this support holds, the bulls will make another attempt to pullback towards $187. However, if the support breaks, the cryptocurrency can fall to the February 02 lows of $107.102. The 50-day SMA has flattened out, which points to possible range bound movement. We will turn bullish when the price breaks out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. We expect Cardano to remain range bound between 0.00001690 and 0.00002460 for the next few days.  The next leg of the down move will start if the ADA/BTC pair breaks below the supports. Still, it has low chances of happening. On the upside, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of 0.00002460, it is likely to start a new uptrend. We recommend long positions once the breakout keeps on. The developing positive divergence on the RSI indicates that a rally is in the offing. Though the bears have broken below the bearish descending triangle pattern on NEO, the bulls are trying to defend the March 18 lows of $49.04.  If the NEO/USD pair breaks below $49.04, it will become negative and can slide to $31.15 levels. The first sign of strength will be if the bulls push the cryptocurrency above $65 levels and settle there.     EOS has been the strongest one among the top cryptocurrencies. It is trading well above its March 18 lows and is close to the 20-day EMA.  If it breaks out of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA, we believe it will start a new uptrend. Therefore, we recommend a long position on the EOS/USD pair at $7.5. The stop loss can be kept at $5 and the target objective is $11. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price declines and stays below $5. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-03-29 20:39:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Gives Away 'The Largest Donation Of Cryptocurrency' To Support Public Schools,"Cointelegraph Cryptocurrency startup Ripple donated $29 mln worth of its own cryptocurrency XRP to support public schools via DonorsChoose charity platform. News Blockchain-based payments network Ripple recently donated $29 mln of its own cryptocurrency XRP to support US public schools, fulfilling over 35,000 funding requests from teachers via DonorsChoose charity fund, as reported by ABC7 March 28. We're so happy to give back to teachers like @kinder_roxs and all their students across the country!Help us build on this momentum up by donating to projects on @DonorsChoose and continue the #BestSchoolDay https://t.co/qY1z7rlZgc According to CNBC, DonorsChoose will convert the donations into US dollars over the course of two weeks in order to avoid the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, and to comply with the company’s policy to sell the donated currency immediately. The donated money will be used to equip more than 30,000 classrooms across all 50 states; “approximately one million students are receiving books, school supplies, technology, field trips, and other resources vital for learning through DonorsChoose.org,” Ripple said in a public statement March 27. According to founder and CEO of DonorsChoose Charles Best, who sent a donation request to Ripple, the move would be “the largest donation of cryptocurrency.” San Francisco-based Ripple’s XRP altcoin token, currently trading at $0.53, is the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which amounts to over $20 bln at press time, according to the data from Coinmarketcap. Ripple is not the first company to donate cryptocurrency to charity. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ethereum (ETH) cofounder Vitalik Buterin partnered with decentralized payment network OmiseGO to donate $1 mln in ERC20 tokens to the African charity GiveDirectly. Earlier in February, Buterin also donated $2.4 mln worth of Ethereum to the SENS Research Foundation, a charity funding research for treating age-related diseases. In December, Bitcoin-exclusive Pineapple Fund donated $1 mln in Bitcoin (BTC) to the Internet Archive. Pineapple Fund aims to give away $86 mln worth of Bitcoin in total to various nonprofit organizations. Hide Comments  For updates and exclusive offers, enter your e-mail below.

2018-03-30 22:26:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, March 30","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry reached $832 bln on January 07 this year, along with the talks of how it would reach $1 trln in 2018. Fast forward three months and the market cap is down to $255 bln, a fall of about 68 percent from the achieved highs. Some analysts believe that the selling might intensify by mid-April as many will be forced to raise money to pay taxes on the gains they earned in 2017. Analysts attribute the fall to tightening regulatory concerns around the globe and the ban on cryptocurrency-related ads by the various social media platforms. Currently, the sentiment is negative, and it might send cryptocurrencies prices lower. Much has been written about the dreaded “death cross” on Bitcoin, when the 50-day moving average will cross below the 200-day moving average. However, it is such a widely watched event that it might work as a contrary indicator. After all, traders who had purchased after the last death cross in September 2015 around the $230 mark smiled away to their banks as the price rose to $500 by November of the same year. We are not suggesting to buy right away, but we believe that a bottom should be around the corner. Let’s watch the critical levels on the top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has broken below our stop loss of $7,600, and our position initiated at $8,800 has been closed. We had suggested long positions because we anticipated a pullback once the digital currency broke out of the descending channel, but we were wrong.  The bears strongly defended the 20-day EMA and pushed prices back into the descending channel once again. There is a minor support at $7,000 below which the BTC/USD pair will retest the February 06 lows of $6,075.04. However, traders should keep an eye on the relative strength index (RSI), which is entering the oversold territory. Previous declines to the oversold zone have turned out to be a good buying opportunity. Over the next couple of days, if we get a panic dip towards $6,000 or below that to $5,450.86, it might turn out to be a good place to buy for the long-term. Investors should watch for prices to stabilize for about four hours and then purchase about 25 percent of the desired allocation. Panic dips, after a prolonged downtrend, should be used to invest. We expect the $5,000 to $6,000 zone to offer a strong support. Ethereum continues to be under pressure. The bulls have failed to even pull back to the 20-day EMA since March 05, which shows complete dominance by the bears. This has resulted in the RSI plunging deep into the oversold territory.  The ETH/USD pair is currently at the strong support zone of $355 to $385. If this support breaks, the next support zone is between $275 and $300. As the RSI is oversold, we expect a relief rally that can reach the downtrend line. Once above this, a move to the 20-day EMA is possible. We should watch for a couple of days before suggesting any long-term positions. Bitcoin Cash broke below the February 06 lows of $778.2021 on March 29. The next support is way lower at the $558 to $600. This level coincides with the support line of the descending channel and the horizontal support. We might see a relief rally from this strong support zone.  The RSI in the oversold zone also supports the possibility of a pullback, however, the BCH/USD pair will face selling at the 20-day EMA, which is right at the resistance line of the descending channel. We recommend waiting for the virtual currency to stop falling before suggesting any trades.        Our stop loss in Ripple was hit when the price fell below $0.52 levels on March 29. We had expected the $0.56270 levels to hold, but we were wrong.  The next major support level on the XRP/USD pair is way lower at $0.22. The lower target levels will be invalidated if the bulls quickly push prices above $0.57 levels. Until then, all pullbacks will be sold into. We recommend a buy when we find a particular level holding for a couple of days. Stellar has broken below the immediate support of $0.20. It is currently trying to take support on the downtrend line.  If this support breaks, the XLM/USD pair can slide to $0.16 and below that to $0.11 levels. Here, the RSI is showing a positive divergence, but we need to wait for the price to turn up before putting any long position on it. Litecoin could not hold the trendline of the symmetrical triangle. It, now, has support at the February 02 lows of $107.102.  If that level also breaks, the LTC/USD pair can slide to $84.708. The RSI is in the oversold zone. We can expect a relief rally soon, but we don’t find any buy setup now, hence, we do not recommend any trading position. While most top cryptocurrencies have continued to break down of critical support levels, Cardano has held its own.  We expect the ADA/BTC pair to remain within the range of 0.00001690 and 0.00002460 for the next few days. We suggest a buy position once prices close above 0.00002460 levels. NEO is trading at the critical levels of $49.04, which is the March 18 lows. If it breaks, there is no major support until the price reaches $31.15 levels.  If the support holds, there can be a possibility of a double bottom formation. Our bearish view on the NEO/USD pair will be invalidated if the prices sustain above $65 levels.     EOS continues to exhibit strength. Prices are trading close to the 20-day EMA. If the sentiment improves across the sector, we expect the virtual currency to break out of the resistance line of the descending channel.  On the downside, $5.1801 is a strong support, below which a retest of the $4 levels might take place. We retain the buy recommendation on the EOS/USD pair at $7.5, for a target objective of $11. The initial stop loss can be placed at $5. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-04-04 23:30:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, April 04","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. In 2017, anything related to Blockchain and cryptocurrency was hot property; in 2018, anything linked with blockchain is having a difficult time. Last year, about 170 hedge funds began trading; in 2018 only 20 new funds have started operations so far. Additionally, chances are 10 percent of the existing funds will close operations this year, due to regulatory uncertainty and market conditions. Even the stock market had joined the frenzy last year when stocks of companies, joining the Blockchain craze, saw their price skyrocket. This year has been the exact opposite, with most of those stocks plunging. Last year was a race to forecast the higher targets on Bitcoin. There were all kinds of outrageous targets and various justifications for the same. Now, it’s time to give targets on the downside. A group of Zurich-based researchers has built a model using the Metcalfe’s law, which shows that Bitcoin’s support is in the market capitalization range of $22 to $44 billion, way lower than the current market cap of $118 billion. As the prices fall, the news and sentiment will get even more bearish. Tops are formed after a buying mania, similarly, bottoms are formed after panic selling. So, let’s keep our buy list ready and start investing when the charts confirm that a bottom is in place.   In a strong downtrend, the pullbacks only last between 1-3 days. So, after two days of closing in the green, Bitcoin turned down from the $7,711.74 levels.  Currently, prices are quoting just above the $7,000 mark, which is an important support. If this level breaks down, a fall to the April 01 lows of $6,757.26 and then to the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 is possible. We’ll see the first signs of bullishness when the BTC/USD pair breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. We shall look to buy only if the price sustains above $8,000 levels. Ethereum closed above the downtrend line on April 03 but could not sustain the breakout. Today, April 04, it has given up all the gains and is threatening to break below the April 01 lows of $358.  If the bears succeed in breaking down the supports, the ETH/USD pair can slide to $300. The weak pullback after such an extensive decline from $870 on March 05 to $358 on April 01 shows a lack of demand. The digital currency remains firmly in a downtrend with both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA falling. We will wait for the trend to change from down to up before suggesting any long positions. We had anticipated Bitcoin Cash to pull back to the 20-day EMA, but the rally fizzled at $741.6764 on April 03.  The BCH/USD pair is struggling to find buyers even at these low levels. If prices break below the April 01 lows of $653, there might be a decline to $600 and $558. We shall wait for the digital currency to change its trend before recommending any trades on it. The recovery in Ripple could not extend above the overhead resistance of $0.56270, which is a bearish sign. Now, if the price breaks down of the April 01 lows of $0.45351, the downtrend will resume.  There is no major support until the price reaches $0.22 levels, that’s why it is difficult to predict where the buyers will step in. The XRP/USD pair will show signs of recovery if it rallies and sustains above $0.57 levels for three days. We aren’t buying during a falling market. Stellar continues to trade inside the descending channel. It failed to break out of the 20-day EMA on April 03. $0.18 is the critical support on the downside, below which, the fall might extend to $0.16.    The only bullish development on the chart is the positive divergence on the RSI, but until the price confirms a turnaround, we aren’t suggesting any long positions. We wait for the XLM/USD pair to break out of the resistance line of the descending channel before initiating any positions. Litecoin bounced close to the trendline where it faced selling, as we had anticipated. Currently, prices have given back all the gains of April 03.  If the bulls fail to defend the critical support zone of $114.706 to $107.102, the LTC/USD pair can slide to the next lower level of $84.708. We shall wait for a bottom formation before suggesting any trade on it. Cardano has been trading inside a range for the past few days. We expect the range bound action to continue until the overall sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.  If the ADA/BTC pair breaks out of the range, we anticipate the start of a new uptrend. However, we want to enter a long position only after the price sustains the breakout for more than three days. Therefore, the recommendation provided in the previous analysis is no longer suitable. We shall wait for the breakout to sustain and then suggest a buy. We don’t want to get caught in a bull trap. NEO attempted a pullback on April 03, but it could not reach the 20-day EMA. It turned down from $54.31 levels, which shows that the bears are still in command. If the price breaks below the April 01 lows of $44.84, we can expect a slide to the next lower support of $31.15.  If the $44.84 level holds, the bulls will again attempt to pull back to the 20-day EMA. First signs of stability will be seen after the NEO/USD pair sustains above the $65 levels. We still don’t have a confirmation of a bottom; hence, it is best to wait for now.     EOS continues to trade inside the descending channel. It is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, which is located near the resistance line of the channel.  If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the overhead resistance, we anticipate another major resistance at the 50-day SMA. The EOS/USD pair will become positive only after it breaks out of $7.25 levels. We retain our existing buy recommendation at $7.5 with a stop loss of $5 and a target objective of $11. If prices break below $5, a slide to $4 is possible. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-04-06 18:42:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, April 06","Cointelegraph Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The Reserve Bank of India has banned regulated financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrencies, citing the risks involved. American billionaire Tim Draper believes that India is making a big mistake by shutting its doors to cryptocurrencies. According to Draper, this will only lead to brain drain as many will be forced to move to other places, which are more crypto-friendly. Japan, which is a major hub for crypto and Blockchain activity is facing shortage of software engineers. There are similar requirements at other places, where Blockchain professionals are in demand. This has forced the top MBA colleges in the world to increase the presence of virtual currency and Blockchain classes in their programs. With the RBI’s move, India will lag behind other nations in the technology of the future. Turning back to Bitcoin’s price, Thomas Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors believes that the cryptocurrency’s sell offs will subside after the mid-April tax filing deadline. He has maintained his year-end targets of $25,000 for Bitcoin and $1,900 for Ethereum. On the other hand, investment research firm Capital Economics believes that Bitcoin will be a huge underperformer compared to the other asset classes in the coming months. Like any other asset type, cryptocurrencies will have analysts taking both bearish and bullish views. But, we shall rely on the chart patterns to initiate trades that offer us a good risk to reward ratio. Let’s see if we find any buy setups today. Bitcoin is close to breaking down of the April 01 lows of $6,757.26 and moving lower towards its next support of $6,075.04. Though the digital currency has fallen below the $7,000 level, we don’t find any significant buying support.  The 20-day EMA is trending down and is placed just above the resistance line of the descending channel. The BTC/USD pair has not broken out of the 20-day EMA since March 08, which shows the extent of selling. This will act as a major resistance on any pullbacks. We suggest a buy only after price breaks out and remains above the 20-day EMA. Ethereum has been trading in a tight range, between $358 and $418.70, since March 30. The trend remains bearish as both moving averages are falling and price continues to make lower highs and lower lows.  If the ETH/USD pair breaks below $358, the downtrend will resume and a fall to $300 levels is likely. If $358 level holds, the digital currency will continue to consolidate in the tight range. On the upside, resistance is at $418.79 and above this at the 20-day EMA. We shall wait for signs of buying to emerge before suggesting any trade. Bitcoin Cash is in a firm bear grip. Prices continue to fall as the support levels fail to attract buyers.  The BCH/USD pair has broken down of the April 01 lows of $653. Its next support is at $558.3870. We shall turn bullish on the digital currency if it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel. Until then, the bears will continue to sell on every small rally.        Ripple is close to the April 01 lows of $0.45351. This is a critical level because the next support on the chart is way lower at $0.22255, which was the low made on December 11 of last year. Therefore, we expect the bulls to strongly defend the $0.45351 mark.  However, if the support breaks, the XRP/USD pair will resume its downtrend and move towards $0.35. With both moving averages falling, we don’t find any buy setups on it. We shall wait for prices to break out of the 20-day EMA and sustain above $0.56270 before proposing any long positions. Stellar is close to its critical support level of $0.184. If this support breaks, the digital currency can decline to $0.16 and below that to $0.1125 levels.    If the $0.184 support holds, we may see a pullback to the resistance line of the channel. We like the way the RSI has maintained its positive divergence. We shall wait for prices to turn up and break out of the 20-day EMA before recommending any short-term trade on the XLM/USD pair. A long-term trade setup will form only if prices break out of the descending channel. Litecoin continues to fall towards its critical support zone of $114.706 to $107.102. If the bulls fail to defend this zone, prices will sink to $84.708 levels.  If the support zone holds, we may see another attempt by the bulls to break out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. While the 20-day EMA is falling, the 50-day SMA is relatively flat. So, if the immediate support holds, the LTC/USD pair can enter into a range. We shall suggest a trade if it breaks out and closes above the 20-day EMA. Cardano turned down after coming close to the upper end of the range on April 04. We expect it to consolidate between 0.00001690 and 0.00002460 for a few more days.  There are two ways to trade a range. Either buy on a breakout or wait for prices to dip to the lower end of the range. We shall wait for either scenario to play out before suggesting any trades on the ADA/BTC pair. The longer the cryptocurrency spends consolidating, the stronger will be the next breakout or breakdown from it. NEO has resumed its downtrend. The bulls are finding it difficult to defend the April 01 lows of $44.84. If the bears sustain below this level, the next major support is at $31.15.  Both moving averages are falling, which shows that the bears are in complete control. First signs of bullishness will be when the bulls break out of the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance of $63.62. Until then, we expect the NEO/USD pair to remain under pressure.     EOS broke out of the descending channel on April 05, but the bulls haven’t been able to sustain the breakout. Prices have again fallen back into the channel.  We believe that even above the channel, there will be a hurdle at the 50-day SMA and the last one at $7.28. The coin will become bullish once it clears these overhead resistances. Among the top cryptocurrencies that we analyze, the EOS/USD pair currently has the best looking charts and the highest probability of starting a new uptrend. Therefore, we recommend a buy at $7.5, keeping a stop loss of $5. Our target objective is a move to $11. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2018-04-09 17:43:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, April 09","Cointelegraph The ongoing bear market might not be such a bad thing, as it helps the markets become mature enough for institutional money. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The current bear market in cryptocurrencies will turn out to be a boon in the long-term. The rally in 2017 had become frothy and attracted mostly retail traders who dreamt of becoming rich overnight. This was not good for the longevity of the virtual currencies. The institutional investors don’t enter in a ‘bubble-like’ environment. Now, with most of the froth removed, we get rumors of some big names showing interest in investing in the digital currencies. A name that stands out is that of the legendary investor George Soros. Bloomberg’s sources confirmed that Adam Fisher, the person in charge of global macroeconomic investing at Soros Fund Management, has received the green signal to proceed with cryptocurrency investing. Another very prominent investor to enter into the crypto world is the Rockefeller family, through their official venture capital arm Venrock. These are not all, as there are a few other macro managers who are showing interest in digital currencies. If the institutional money starts pouring in, it will put a floor beneath most of the larger cryptocurrencies. Let’s see if we can find any signs of a bottom in them. Bitcoin remains stuck in a downtrend. It is currently sliding towards the support of $6,757.26, after failing to break out of the resistance line of the descending channel. If the bears break below the support, a fall to $6075.04 is possible.  In the very short-term, the BTC/USD pair has formed a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown below $6757.26. The pattern target on the downside is $5435.66. If the bulls defend the $6757.26 levels and subsequently break out of the 20-day EMA, it will signal strength. We shall wait for buyers to emerge before recommending any long positions. The bulls attempted to break out of the tight range but prices could not sustain the higher levels. As a result, Ethereum has again fallen into the range.    Now, the bears will attempt to break down of the range. If successful, the ETH/USD pair will resume its journey towards its lower target objective of $300. Considering the strong downtrend, we shall wait for the cryptocurrency to break out of the descending channel before proposing any trades. We are yet to see any strong buying in Bitcoin Cash. The bulls are making a half hearted attempt to push prices towards the resistance line of the descending channel.  At $778.2021, there is a confluence of three resistances, the 20-day EMA, the resistance line of the descending channel and the horizontal line. Prices will gain strength only above this level. Until then, the bears will continue to sell on rallies. We shall turn positive on the BCH/USD pair only after it sustains above $780 levels for a couple of days. Ripple held the April 01 lows of $0.45351 and is trying to recover, but the buying is very sluggish. Its overhead resistance is at $0.56270.  The XRP/USD pair can remain range bound between $0.45351 and $0.56270 for the next few days. Once the virtual currency breaks out of this range, it can rally to the $0.72, where it will face resistance from the 50-day SMA. A breakdown of the consolidation will sink it to $0.35 levels. We shall wait for a confirmed break out and close above $0.56270 before recommending any trade. Stellar has held its first critical support level of $0.184 but it has turned down from the 20-day EMA. If price breaks down of the immediate support, it can decline to $0.16.    If the XLM/USD pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it can rally to the resistance line of the descending channel. The digital currency has been trading inside the channel since early January of this year. Hence, a break out of this will be a significant event and will signal a change in trend. We shall wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the resistance line before proposing any trades. Litecoin held the first support level of $114.706 but its recovery attempt stalled at $126. It could not even reach the downtrend line 1. The 20-day EMA is also located close to this line.  If the bears break below $114.706, the LTC/USD pair can fall to $107.102, which is a February 02 low. This should act as a strong support but if this also breaks, the next support on the downside is at $84.706. First signs of a change in trend will be when the digital currency breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line 1. Though Cardano continues to trade in a range, it is forming a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout above 0.00002460 levels.  The pattern target of a breakout above the upper end of the range is 0.0000323, but we believe that the up move can extend to 0.000035 levels. Hence, we suggest a long position on the ADA/BTC pair on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above 0.0000246. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at 0.00002. If the bulls fail to achieve the breakout, a few more days of range bound action will continue. The bulls have held onto the $44 levels for the last few days, resulting in a pullback, which carried NEO to the 20-day EMA.    The zone between the 20-day EMA and $63.62 is a major resistance. Once this zone is crossed, the NEO/USD pair will turn positive in the short term and rally towards the 50-day SMA at $83 and above this to the downtrend line. However, if the bulls fail to break out of the overhead resistance, we might see another attempt to break the $44 levels.      We shall recommend a buy on the digital currency around the $65 mark. EOS tried to break out of the descending channel for the second time within five days but failed. It is showing strength but it has a slew of resistances from the current levels up to $7.28.  We like the EOS/USD pair because it did not revisit its March 18 lows of $3.8723 in the recent correction. This shows that the buyers are accumulating on every small dip and there is a lack of sellers at these levels. We have recommended initiating long positions at $7.5 after the virtual currency clears the overhead resistances. This will pave way for a rally to $11 levels. The stop loss can be kept at $5 initially, which can be trailed higher subsequently. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.

2018-02-14 14:57:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Ripple Partners With Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority To Offer Pilot Program For Banks,"Cointelegraph Ripple and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority have announced a partnership to form a pilot program for cross-border payments with Saudi Arabian banks. News Ripple has announced an agreement today, Feb. 14, with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to provide support for Ripple’s cross-border payments technology to banks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). SAMA and Ripple have created a pilot program to provide support to KSA banks to use xCurrent, Ripple’s enterprise software solution that enables banks to instantly settle cross-border payments with end-to-end tracking. The first of its kind to be launched by a central bank, the pilot program will allow participating KSA banks to use xCurrent for cross-border payment payments. SAMA will support KSA banks with a regulatory sandbox, program management and training. Dilip Rao, Ripple’s global head of infrastructure innovation, said: “Central banks around the world are leaning into Blockchain technology in recognition of how it can transform cross-border payments, resulting in lower barriers to trade and commerce for both corporates [sic] and consumers.” Rao added, “SAMA is leading the charge as the first central bank to provide resources to domestic banks that want to enable instant payments using Ripple’s innovative blockchain solution.” Ripple has partnerships with over 100 financial institutions, most recently last week partnering with LianLian International, a China-based payment services provider.

2018-02-15 14:55:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,Western Union Confirms Testing Ripple Technology For Money Transfers,"Cointelegraph Western Union has confirmed testing transactions based on Ripple’s Blockchain to provide faster and cheaper domestic and cross-border transfers. News The financial services provider Western Union (WU) is testing transactions with the use of Ripple’s (XRP) Blockchain-based settlement system, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal said in an interview with Bloomberg Feb. 14. The globally known money transfer company Western Union confirmed that it is testing Ripple following more than a month of rumor-fuelled speculation that began in early January. The announcement comes after Western Union reported its 2017 results, claiming a revenue of $1.4 bln - a 5 percent increase over the previous year. As Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Bloomberg, WU has decided to look into their platform in order to facilitate money transfers, particularly cross-border ones. Garlinghouse explained their choice by claiming that Ripple allows for transactions that are “a thousand times faster and a thousand times cheaper than Bitcoin’s.” According to Bloomberg, Western Union’s Chief Executive Officer Hikmet Ersek also confirmed that testing is taking place during a conference call Tuesday, Feb. 13. “We are looking especially in the processing settlement and working capital optimization, also in the regulation part, on the compliance part on the blockchain capabilities,” Ersek said, adding “we do have some tests with Ripple.” Ripple (XRP) is a Blockchain-based settlement protocol and a cryptocurrency that has reached almost half of Bitcoin’s market capitalization in early January 2018, when its price rallied to over $3.00 per coin. By the middle of January, however, the XRP price has bounced back to a little over $1.00. Wednesday, Feb. 14, Cointelegraph reported on a partnership signed between Ripple and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to provide the technology for cross-border payments to banks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).

2018-02-17 00:23:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 16","Cointelegraph Latest trading review on most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After a massive sell-off earlier this year, the cryptocurrencies are trying to pull back. Among the top coins, Litecoin has garnered all the attention with favorable news and an upcoming fork on Feb. 18. At the same time, Western Union, one of the oldest money transfer companies, has confirmed it is testing Ripple’s Blockchain-based settlement system. George Soros, who had earlier referred to cryptocurrencies as a “typical bubble” has invested in Overstock, through his investment fund. Overstock is one of the most pro-cryptocurrencies businesses, and its stock price has appreciated immensely as the cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. This shows that the mainstream businesses are slowly recognizing the value of blockchain technology. However, a few old-timers are still skeptical of cryptocurrencies and the latest to voice his opinion is Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger, who called Bitcoin “totally asinine.” Nevertheless, as traders, if an asset class offers us an opportunity, we take it. Let’s see if we find some interesting plays today.   Our recommendation of a long position in Bitcoin triggered on Feb. 15. Traders, who follow us, would have entered their positions between $9,500 and $9,700. We had anticipated that once the cryptocurrency broke out of the overhead resistance, it would rally towards the 50-day SMA. But the price action above $9,500 has not been encouraging.    We prefer breakouts that quickly gain momentum once they clear a resistance area. In this case, the BTC/USD pair is facing selling pressure at the resistance line, as shown in the chart. If the cryptocurrency holds the $9,500 levels and breaks out of the resistance line, it is likely to continue trading inside the ascending channel and reach the 50-day SMA, where traders can book profits on 50 percent of their positions and hold the rest with a trailing stop loss for a target of about $12,500. Bitcoin is at risk of a bear attack as long as it trades inside the descending channel. Therefore, we want to reduce our risk. We recommend raising the stop loss on 50 percent positions to $8,600 and keeping the rest at the previously mentioned level of $7,800.     Ethereum triggered our buy levels on Feb.14. But, it also has failed to extend its pullback. It entered a small range day yesterday, Feb. 15, and is following it up with another short range day today, Feb.16.    While the ETH/USD pair has not given up any ground, it has struggled to move up. Our first target objective was a move to the 50-day SMA, currently close to the $1,000 mark followed by a rally to $1,050 levels. The stop loss remains at $775, because we don’t find any higher logical stop loss level. Bitcoin Cash has broken out of the resistance zone and has triggered our buy levels of $1,400 today. We now expect a rally to the 50-day SMA at $1,818, followed by a move to $2,000.      Breaking out of the long-term downtrend line and the 20-day EMA is a bullish sign. But if the other cryptocurrencies turn down, the BCH/USD pair may also find it difficult to rally. Therefore, we retain the stop loss at $1,100, below which a fall to $854 is likely.   Ripple rose above our suggested buy level on Feb. 14. Despite our opinion, it has again entered into a tight range since Feb.15.  As the XRP/USD pair continues to trade above the 20-day EMA, we expect it to gain momentum and quickly rally to $1.5 levels, where traders can book profits on 50 percent positions. The remaining stops can be trailed for a higher target objective of $1.74. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency falls below the stop loss of $0.86.          Stellar broke out of the descending channel and triggered our buy level at $0.45. As the markets have rejected the break below $0.41, we expect a move to the overhead resistance level of $0.63.  As long as the XLM/USD pair sustains above the 20-day EMA and the $0.41 levels, a rally towards $0.63 is likely. Hence, we recommend holding the position with the suggested stop loss of $0.30 on a daily closing basis (as per UTC). Yesterday, Feb. 15, Litecoin continued its up move, breaking out of the small overhead resistance at $214.483. Our readers are long from the $180 levels. We had forecast a rally to $242, and yesterday, the cryptocurrency reached $239.705 levels, very close to our target objective.  We believe that as long as the LTC/USD pair stays above $214.483 levels, it is on target to reach $242. Once above this, a move to $270 and, after that, to $307 is likely. So, traders should book 50 percent profits at $240 and keep a trailing stop loss on the remaining position. For now, we suggest raising the stop loss to break even. Let’s not lose any money on the trade. Cardano has completed a breakdown from the bearish descending triangle pattern. It has one final support at 0.00003700, below which, a fall to 0.0000246 is likely.    The ADA/BTC pair remains negative as long as it trades below the overhead resistance of 0.00004070. We should turn positive on the cryptocurrency if it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle.    Our long position on NEO at $121, suggested in the previous analysis was triggered on Feb. 14.     Yesterday, Feb. 15, efforts by the bears to push the NEO/USD pair back below the support of $120.33 failed. This shows that the bulls are providing support at lower levels. Our target objective is a move to the downtrend line of the descending triangle. We recommend raising the stop loss from $100 to $107. We don’t want to hang on to the trade if it falls below $120.33 levels. EOS is currently facing resistance from the 20-day EMA. Above this, it is again likely to face resistance from the downtrend line. Just above the downtrend line lies the 50-day SMA.  As there is a confluence of resistance in the $9.8 to $10.7 zone, we are not suggesting any trade. We should buy once the EOS/USD pair breaks out of this resistance zone.

2018-02-20 02:39:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, Feb. 19","Cointelegraph The latest top 9 cryptocurrencies analysis, make sure you check it to find out what’s going to happen with the prices. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After failing to stem the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies through their warnings, the central banks have stooped down to funding anti-crypto campaigns. This move will only reduce the confidence in the central banks and encourage new investors to enter the crypto world. At the same time, the Venezuelan government is planning to launch a new cryptocurrency called the petro. Each new coin will supposedly be backed by one barrel of oil. However, there is a big question on the central bank’s credibility that is issuing the petro. Analysts believe that the petro is most likely to end up not bringing the expected results. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to attract big-ticket investments. After the recent fall, there are reports of a trader buying about $400 million worth of Bitcoin between Feb. 09 to Feb. 12. People are gradually turning positive on Bitcoin once again. Shark Tank’s Robert Herjavec believes that Bitcoin will top its 2017 mid-December high of about $20,000 in the short-term. Let’s see what does the chart pattern forecast? Traders who follow us are carrying long positions that triggered on Feb. 15. We had recommended booking 50 percent profits at the 50-day SMA, and most traders should have sold when Bitcoin rallied to an intraday high of $11,348.99, yesterday, Feb.18. We had also recommended trailing the remaining positions with a suitable stop loss. As every trader has a different trading strategy, we did not provide any specific trailing stop loss. The BTC/USD pair is trading inside an ascending channel. As long as it trades above the support line of the channel, it can reach $12,000 levels. In case of a fall, the support line of the ascending channel and the 20-day EMA will be acting as strong support. If these two levels break, the price might fall to $8,400. Therefore, traders who are still left with 50 percent positions should keep the stop loss at $9,800. We did not recommend closing the complete position because Bitcoin will become positive once it sustains above the descending channel.     Ethereum rallied close to the 50-day SMA yesterday, Feb. 18, reaching an intraday high of $979, close to our target objective of $1,000. Hope traders would have book profits on 50% positions. For the past four days, the ETH/USD pair has been taking support at $900 levels. Therefore, we recommend raising the stop loss on the remaining position from $775 to $900. The target objective is a move to the resistance line of the descending channel. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the channel, a move to $1,200 is likely. On the other hand, if the bears break down below $900, there might be a fall to $780 levels. Our target objective on Bitcoin Cash was a rally to the 50-day SMA, close to $1,800 levels, however, yesterday, Feb.18, it turned down from $1,639.251 levels.      Our initial stop loss was placed at $1,100. We want to raise this stop loss to $1,400 because if most cryptocurrencies turn down from their resistances, the BCH/USD pair might follow suit. So let’s not lose money on it. On the upside, please book partial profits above $1,750 and hold the rest with a trailing stop loss for a target objective of $2,000.   Contrary to our expectation, Ripple continues to trade in a tight range. It has not participated in the pullback like the other top cryptocurrencies. The only consolation is that it is sustaining above the 20-day EMA for the past four days.  We had suggested an initial stop loss of $0.86, but we should raise this stop higher because if the top currencies turn down, the XRP/USD pair will also fall sharply. Please raise the stops on the complete position to $0.95. If the tight range resolves on the upside, please book profits on 50 percent position at $1.45. Trail the remaining position for a second target objective of $1.74.          Stellar also has been stuck in a tight range for the past four days. It is trading close to our suggested buy levels of $0.45.  We anticipate a move to the upper end of the range at $0.63. But for that, the XLM/USD pair will have to break out of the 50-day SMA. On the downside, supports lie at the 20-day EMA, the horizontal line at $0.41, and the channel line at $0.38. For now, please maintain the stop loss at $0.30 on a daily closing basis (as per UTC). We need to consider raising it in a couple of days. In our previous analysis, we had recommended to book profits on 50 percent positions at $240, and Litecoin reached an intraday high of $239.5 on Feb. 16. We hope that the traders would have sold half of their positions established at $180.  For the past four days, the LTC/USD pair has been trading in a range of about $208 to $240. A breakout of this range will be a positive move, and we anticipate a rally to $270 and then to $307. Our stop loss is currently at breakeven. We want to reduce our risk and pocket some of the paper profits. That’s why we should raise the stops on the remaining 50 percent long positions to $200. We have been bearish on Cardano for the past few days because it has broken down of the bearish descending triangle pattern. Though a pullback to the breakdown levels of 0.00004070 is possible, the cryptocurrency remains negative as long as it trades below the downtrend line of the descending triangle.  The ADA/BTC pair is likely to slide to the next support level of 0.0000246. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line, because a failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. As NEO is trading inside a descending triangle pattern, we had recommended a quick trade with a long at $121 and a target objective of a rally to the downtrend line of the descending triangle pattern.     The NEO/USD pair reached our target objective on Feb. 17, reaching a high of $138.35, where the traders must have closed their positions. An attempt by the bears to sink the cryptocurrency failed Feb. 18. It is currently trying to break out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle, which will invalidate the bearish pattern. If the bulls sustain the breakout, we might see a rally to $169. On the downside, the moving averages and the horizontal line at $120.33 might act as strong support. As expected, EOS turned down from the downtrend line yesterday, Feb. 18. The 20-day EMA is at $9.76, and the 50-day SMA is at $10.8.  We believe that the bulls will face stiff resistance in the zone of $9.76 to $10.8. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions above $11, if the EOS/USD pair sustains the level for four hours. The target objective on the upside is a rally to $15 levels. The stop loss can be placed at $8.8. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

2018-02-22 22:30:00,Ripple,cointelegraph,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, NEO, EOS: Price Analysis, February 21, 2018","Cointelegraph Don’t miss the latest trading review on top 9 most popular cryptocurrencies. Price Analysis The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The financial world seems not to have made up its mind yet about cryptocurrencies. Paul Singer, founder of investment management firm Elliott Management called cryptos “one of the most brilliant scams in history” whereas Tim Draper, a prominent venture capital investor, has held on to his Bitcoin, and, when asked if he is going to sell them, said: “Why would I sell the future for the past”. Meanwhile major exchanges Coinbase and Bitfinex are aiming to implement the Segregated Witness (SegWit) scalability upgrade into their systems, which will significantly cut fees and transaction time for the users. Will this news turn out to be bullish for Bitcoin and the other top digital currencies? Let’s find out. Yesterday, February 20, Bitcoin reached our second target objective when it met the resistance line of the descending channel. Traders following us should have sold out their positions around $12,000. What should they do now?  The BTC/USD pair has almost doubled from its recent lows, therefore some profit booking is to be expected at the current levels. However, it remains bullish as long as it trades inside the ascending channel. If the bears break down below the support line of the ascending channel, a fall towards the 20-day EMA at $10,000 and below that to the horizontal support line at $9,500 is possible. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $12,200 and rallies towards $13,000.     The stop loss suggested by us in our previous analysis triggered yesterday, February 20. Ethereum has now broken below the 20-day EMA, which is a bearish sign.  On the downside, we expect the ETH/USD pair to fall to between $780 and $772 levels, which is a strong support zone. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls push the digital currency back above the 20-day EMA, towards $1,000 levels. However, the probability of such a rally is low. Our recommended stop loss of $1,400 triggered today, February 21. Bitcoin Cash has not performed according to expectations. It failed to gain momentum and move towards the 50-day SMA.        The bears have broken below the 20-day EMA, which is a bearish sign. There is one final support at $1,350. If this support breaks, the BCH/USD pair can correct towards $1,200 levels once again. Our view will be negated if the bulls break out of the trendline and move up to $1,600.    After trading in a tight range from February 15 to 19, Ripple broke down of this range yesterday, February 20.. It has also fallen below the 20-day EMA; this indicates weakness. Our suggested stop loss of $0.95 has not yet been breached. But unless the bulls quickly climb above the 20-day EMA, a fall to $0.87 is likely.  The XRP/USD pair will gain strength only if it breaks out and sustains above $1.23. We expect the cryptocurrency to remain range bound between $0.87 and $1.2 over the next few days.          Stellar has turned down and has broken below the critical support of $0.41. Currently, it is taking support at the channel line; unless it breaks above $0.41 quickly, it might turn negative.  Our stop loss is way lower at $0.30. As most top coins are showing weakness, we should raise the stop loss on the XLM/USD pair to $0.35 on a daily closing basis (UTC). If the cryptocurrency again enters the channel, it will mean bearish development, and this will raise the chances of a breakdown below $0.30 levels.   We had previously anticipated a rally to $270, but Litecoin could only touch the $256.818 levels yesterday, February 20. Higher levels attracted profit booking, resulting in a pullback.  The LTC/USD pair is stronger compared to the other top coins as it is trading above both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA. The moving averages are also forming a bullish crossover, which is another positive sign. The price might find support at the trendline, around the $214 mark. Nevertheless, if all the cryptocurrencies fall, Litecoin positions will not be damaged. Therefore, we recommend raising the stop loss on the remaining position to $210. The digital currency will gain momentum if it reverses direction and sustains above $240. Our bearish view on Cardano has played out according to our forecast. The cryptocurrency has been falling for almost 10 days. This has pushed the RSI into oversold territory and also increases the possibility of a pullback to the overhead resistance level of 0.00004070.  The falling 20-day EMA is also close to this level. We won’t be surprised to see the ADA/BTC attempting to rise in the next couple of days. However, the trend remains down and we expect the price to fall to the next support level of 0.0000246. The bulls tried to break out of the descending triangle pattern on February 19 and 20, but were unsuccessful in settling at higher levels. NEO reversed direction yesterday, February 20 and reentered the descending triangle.     Today, the NEO/USD pair is trying to hold on to the critical support of the moving averages and $120.33. If this support zone breaks, a fall to $100 is likely. We will turn bullish if the cryptocurrency breaks out and sustains above $140. EOS did not reach our buy levels of $11. It turned down from the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, which is a bearish sign.  The EOS/USD pair has support at $7.91. If this support breaks, the price might fall to $7. On the upside, a breakout above $10.50 will indicate a possible shift in trend. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView.
