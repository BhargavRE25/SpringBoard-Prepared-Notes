2017-05-16 06:00:27,Ripple,bitcoin,"Ripple Market Capitalization Soars, Surges Past Ethereum","              $BCH               $BTC Ripple tokens have hit a massive upswing in market capitalization over the last day, surging past Ethereum and nipping at bitcoin’s heels. Also Read: Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Considers Bitcoin At end of day May 14, Ripple’s market capitalization was at about $8,345,000,000. Ripple continued surging well into the next day at about $11,500,000,000, continuing to climb. This has occurred in an oscillating fashion over the last few weeks, as Ethereum and the blockchain transfer token duke it out for supremacy.  Several news sites and other sources suggest this upswing in market capitalization was spurred by recent partnerships in the ripple network. These partnerships include large banking conglomerates and other banking organizations opting to work with or adopt the Ripple network. An April 26 Ripple press announcement said, Ripple is proud to announce the addition of 10 new customers to our growing global network. These financial institutions include MUFG, BBVA, SEB, Akbank, Axis Bank, YES BANK, SBI Remit, Cambridge Global Payments, Star One Credit Union and eZforex.com, representing some of the world’s largest banks, innovative smaller banks, and payment service providers (PSPs). Even though Ripple is gaining ground on market capitalization, there are distinctions between Ripple tokens and currencies like bitcoin and Ethereum. For instance, Ripple has enjoyed its market capitalization skyrocket as a result of gaining the aforesaid partnerships. This happened because Ripple is a “bank coin.” Several commentators pointed out ripple is not a decentralized cryptocurrency. It is a centralized bank-to-bank transfer coin. Ripple’s own commentary from their labs suggested the same when they mentioned being able to use a global freeze feature. “The freeze protocol extension gives gateways the ability to 1) globally freeze all their issued funds, or 2) freeze funds issued to a particular user. Frozen funds may only be sent back to the gateway who issued them.” This ability to freeze funds means that Ripple is not a decentralized blockchain protocol, but instead a distributed database that maintains control of the network from a central hub. This is a feature that would be impossible to execute if the coin was founded on decentralized algorithms. This comes to no surprise to many, though, because this fact is not a hidden agenda. Ripple’s website explained the purpose of their technology: Its purpose is to be an inter-bank transfer protocol to smooth out the financial interactions between banks. In this regard, Ripple’s market cap has increased as a result of their partnerships. These alliances caused the market capitalization to swell beyond Ethereum, even though Ripple is not in the same category of coin. It happened as a result of their positioning in the market. It happened because of a business alliance. By definition and design, Ripple is not meant to be a cryptocurrency. It is a “database coin” that is controlled via centralization and economic engineers. Will Ripple’s token continue to grow on into the future? Can it maintain the second position in terms of market capitalization?

2017-06-07 10:50:52,Ripple,bitcoin,Blockchain Exchange Bitsane Introduces Ripple Trading,"              $BCH               $BTC This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material. Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release. Bitsane, the Irish Blockchain trading platform adds Ripple trading support on its cryptocurrency-to-fiat spot exchange services. June 7, 2017, Dublin, Ireland – Dublin-based blockchain platform Bitsane.com announced the addition of XRP (Ripple) to its cryptocurrency-to-fiat spot exchange services on May 22nd, 2017. Soon after, the promising cryptocurrency startup significantly contributed to the ecosystem as a sponsor during the recent Consensus 2017 conference in New York. Bitsane also hosted its own exhibition stand and offered promotional packages to Consensus visitors. Promo packs at the event included company branded USB flash memory sticks, stickers and (Buy/Sell) flip coins. Since its successful launch in 2016, Bitsane has been working towards evolving its platform to make trading cryptocurrencies and fiat as easy as possible. The platform already supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), DASH, Advcash and Iconomi (ICN). In addition, all cryptocurrencies on the platform can be traded against USD, EUR, and BTC. Ripple is the most recent addition to the platform, following AdvCash, DASH and Iconomi transactions, which were introduced in February 2017. Following Ripple’s recent mainstream exposure, Bitsane recognized its potential and made a choice to include the cryptocurrency to its growing platform. Ripple is a settlement system, currency exchange, and remittance network built upon a distributed open source internet protocol, consensus ledger and native currency called XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable secure, instant and “nearly free” global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks. Ripple supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple is based on a shared, public database or ledger, which uses a consensus process that allows for payments, exchanges, and remittance in a distributed process. In addition to web-based trading and exchange platform, Bitsane also enables its users to trade on their mobile devices. The platform offers full API access to developers, encouraging them to build powerful cryptocurrency applications using Bitsane’s tools and services. Bitsane’s recent support of Ripple to fiat trading and its major contributions to Consensus 2017 represents the growth of the company, which from being a startup has graduated to become a mature cryptocurrency business. With a growing footprint, Bitsane is asserting itself in an increasingly competitive market. The cryptocurrency exchange is already the biggest in Ireland, and as it continues its current path, it could soon become one of the world’s leading platforms.

2017-06-21 10:30:25,Ripple,bitcoin,New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode with Stefan Thomas of Ripple Labs,"              $BCH               $BTC During this week’s Bitcoin.com podcast our host, Richard Jacobs, sits down with Stefan Thomas, CTO of Ripple Labs to discuss his company’s “real-time gross settlement protocol” Ripple (XRP). Also read: New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode with Charlie Shrem and Anthony Di Iorio of Jaxx Currently, traditional settlement times for international bank transfers can cost a lot of money and days to complete the payment. Ripple Labs is positioning itself to help provide banks and large financial institutions save billions in fees and deliver significantly faster settlement times. The Ripple settlement system has been used by well-known institutions such as Santander, UBS, and Unicredit. The company claims to provide “secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.” Thomas believes 26 trillion dollars worldwide is held back due to regulatory hurdles, and insufficient transparency between banking partners causing a lack of trust. The Ripple protocol aims to improve the existing financial infrastructure. “Ripple works with banks to improve the financial infrastructure that [banks] use for cross-border payments,” explains Thomas during the podcast. We help banks improve that user experience and also drive costs down  Ripple believes their settlement system can provide a more efficient alternative to international banking protocols such as Swift and ACH transfers. Over the past year, there has been great interest in Ripple’s interbank transactions, and the protocol’s tokens have substantially increased in value over the previous five months. Thomas describes in great detail how he believes his company’s XRP token and IOU infrastructure can free up billions of dollars worldwide and ultimately change the traditional settlement system. Check out Bitcoin.com’s podcast here, or stream the show below to hear more from Ripple Labs CTO, Stefan Thomas, and why he thinks the company’s protocol will revolutionize traditional settlement and finance.

2017-09-11 01:00:06,Ripple,bitcoin,Ripple Labs Enters Legal Dispute With R3,"              $BCH               $BTC Ripple Labs Inc and R3 Hondco LLC filed lawsuits against each other on Friday. The suit is in relation to Ripple’s attempted termination of a 2016 options contract that grants R3 the right to purchase up to 5 billion XRP tokens at $0.0085 USD each until September 2019. Also Read: New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode With Stefan Thomas of Ripple Labs  Ripple Labs and R3 Holdco LLC agreed upon the deal in September 2016, which was formalized through the issuance of an options contract to R3. The lawsuit alleges that Brad Garlinghouse, Chief Executive of Ripple, sought to terminate the options contract via an email which was sent to R3’s Chief Executive, David Rutter. R3 has sued Ripple in response to the email, arguing that the contract cannot be unilaterally terminated. R3 is asking the court to rule that R3 is entitled to all rights outlined in the 2016 contract. With XRP tokens now trading for more than $0.20 each, the contract would entitle R3 to purchase tokens from Ripple Labs before immediately selling them for an approximate gain of over 2000%.  Ripple counter-sued R3 in San Francisco, alleging that R3 had failed to deliver on a different partnership agreed upon by both companies that would give Ripple access to R3’s consortium of financial institutions in exchange for 15% of any revenue generated by Ripple through commercial partnership with banks associated with R3. Ripple’s suit also alleges that R3 touted major institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who exited R3’s network shortly after the establishment of the deal Ripple has requested that court declare to be invalid, and to mandate that R3 pay damages to Ripple. A representative of Ripple labs has stated that the company’s “filing is straightforward – R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP’s ~4000 percent increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement.” R3 has stated that it “does not discuss the details of pending litigation. We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter.” Whose lawsuit do you think the court will recognize? Share your thoughts in the comments section below!

2017-11-17 22:30:15,Ripple,bitcoin,Ripple CEO and Ethereum Co-Founder Bash ICO Industry,"              $BCH               $BTC In a recent interview, Ripple chief executive officer, Brad Garlinghouse, and Ethereum co-founder, Joseph Lubin, have criticized the current state of the ICO industry. The pair expressed concerns that although many “high-quality projects” are using ICOs as a fundraising vehicle, numerous “copycat projects” have raised money without “intend[ing] to deliver any value to the people buying the tokens.” Also Read: China’s Central Television Warns of the Risks of Cryptocurrency OTC Trade Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, expressed his belief that “a lot of what’s happening in the ICO market is actually fraud,” also mentioning the increasing number of ICOs facing litigation. Although concerned by the actions of many token sales, Garlinghouse expects that said fraudulent activity will “stop” once regulators catch up with the industry. Garlinghouse also asserted that token issuers currently operate in a legal “gray area,” whilst they wait for regulators to catch up with the industry. The Ripple CEO suggested that the futures markets may prove to be analogous – as it took significant time to develop a regulatory framework for the futures markets. “There are a lot of really fabulous things that get done with digital assets and blockchain technologies to reduce friction, to reduce costs, and enable things that weren’t possible before. I think instead of focusing on those, we’re distracted by what’s going on in this gray area.” Joseph Lubin stated that although ICOs are being conducted by many “high-quality projects, …there have been a lot of copycat projects where people copy all the same materials (and) don’t intend to deliver any value to the people buying the tokens.” Mr. Lubin asserts that many of the said “copycat projects” were based in China, leading him to support China’s decision to ban token sales within its borders. “With China’s political approach to things, and with the fraud that was rampant there, it made a lot of sense for them to pause things a little bit and get a better, deeper understanding of the ecosystem, and scare potential fraud perpetrators,” Lubin said.

2017-12-30 07:55:57,Ripple,bitcoin,"Ripple Gains 1,000% in One Month – Now the Second Largest Cryptocurrency","              $BCH               $BTC Today, the total market capitalization of Ripple exceeded $100 billion for the first time ever. This milestone makes Ripple the first cryptocurrency other than bitcoin to break into the 12-figure threshold, and positions it as the second largest crypto by total market capitalization.  Also Read: Markets Update: Bitcoin Markets Retrace to the $15,000 Area The value of XRP has skyrocketed this month, surging from less than $0.25 USD on the 1st of December to set an all-time high of roughly $2.50 earlier today on Bitfinex. The price spike has witnessed Ripple come to comprise the second largest cryptocurrency by total market capitalization, with XRP becoming the first altcoin to exceed a total market cap of $100 billion USD. As of this writing, XRP is trading for approximately $2.35.  XRP broke above its preceding all-time high of approximately $0.40 on the 13th of December – at the time comprising a gain of roughly 100% since the 8th of December. Following the establishment of a new record price high, the XRP markets continued to surge, producing further gains of more than 500% in less than three weeks. Looking at a daily chart, the last two weeks of trade has produced volume divergence despite the price continuing to gain hundreds of percent – suggesting that the establishment of a local top may be coming soon in the XRP markets.  On the 7th of December, Ripple announced that it had successfully locked up 55 billion XRP via a “cryptographically secured escrow account”. Ripple originally published its intention to conduct the lockup in May, stating that “By securing the lion’s share of our XRP, investors can now mathematically verify the maximum supply of XRP that can enter the market.” The lockup was conducted using the “escrow feature in the XRP ledger” which Ripple launched during early 2017. The company has utilized the escrow feature to “establish 55 billion contracts of 1 billion XRP each that will expire on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. As each contract expires, the XRP will become available for Ripple’s use,” with the company stating that it may “use [the] XRP for incentives to market makers who offer tighter spreads for payments and selling XRP to institutional investors.” Ripple adds that any unused XRP will be “return[ed]… to the back of the escrow rotation.” Do you think that the XRP markets will continue to rally heading into 2018?

2017-12-30 21:55:39,Ripple,bitcoin,Is the Centralized Ripple Database With the Biggest Pre-Mine Really a Bitcoin Competitor?,"              $BCH               $BTC The rise of ripple (XRP) over the past eight months has been interesting to many digital asset spectators and the network also has its fair share of controversy. At the moment XRPs are trading at an average of $2.20-2.40 per token and ripple’s total market valuation has captured $91Bn this week. Many skeptics are wondering what’s behind the recent XRP price spike and speculate a big correction could be imminent. Also Read: Ripple Gains 1,000% in One Month – Now the Second Largest Cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) is making some serious headway this week as the protocol’s token value has grown exponentially over the past few months. The Ripple network and its parent company, Ripple Labs, considers itself an all-in-one remittance network and currency exchange. The protocol is called a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) which acts as a distributed ledger between a network of nodes. These nodes or validating servers do not offer an incentive like the Bitcoin network’s proof-of-work (PoW) as the network is managed by independently owned servers. This has led to accusations that Ripple’s network is extremely centralized because most validating servers are operated by banks, market makers, and Ripple Labs. Financial institutions that have been using Ripple include Earthpoint, Fidor Bank, Bank of America, and HSBC.  With no PoW and just a group of validating nodes, all 100 billion XRP tokens were created during the initial launch of the Ripple network. 38 billion of these XRPs are currently in circulation, while the founders of the database and the company took the remainder of the XRP holdings. Skeptics say one of the scariest aspects of ripple markets is the fact that Ripple Labs controls over 60 billion XRP which is more than half of what is currently in circulation.   Ripple was established in 2012 by Ryan Fugger and Jed McCaleb and was initially called Ripplepay. The co-founder Jed McCaleb is well known for also helping Mt Gox get its start with Mark Karpeles. McCaleb at the time rebranded the Ripplepay company to Ripple and helped promote the public database until late 2013. McCaleb then left the company that year to start his own venture called the Stellar network which is basically a fork of XRP’s codebase but a different distribution process. In 2014 XRP markets dropped in value considerably as it was rumored that Jed McCaleb was planning to sell off his shares of 9 Billion XRP. It is still unconfirmed to this day if McCaleb actually followed through with the ripple sale. Another Ripple founder, Chris Larsen, donated 7 billion XRP to charity roughly around the same timeframe. Then McCaleb appeared in the headlines again as publications ran stories about him trying to sell more of his founding XRP shares on the Bitstamp exchange. Ripple Labs decided that the sale was not in the best interest of the network so the XRPs were frozen. The “freezing” of McCaleb’s funds revealed an interesting feature tied to the Ripple public database. Ripple Labs can freeze XRP accounts using two possible methods: one can stop the functionality of an individual account while the “global freeze” can bring the entire network to a halt. The global freeze is not a rumor, and Ripple Labs issued a statement about it on August 1, 2014. Further, a Ripple Labs representative told the cryptocurrency columnist, Sean Wince, back in April of 2015 how the freeze works and supposedly users have a choice. “The Ripple protocol allows each gateway to decide its own policy, so users have a choice between using a freeze or no-freeze gateway, depending on their preference,” Monica Long, VP of marketing and communications at Ripple Labs told the reporter Sean Wince.  It is a necessary legal requirement for a gateway to operate in most jurisdictions. It also supports a healthy ecosystem by reducing risks and protecting users. If a user thinks his or her funds were unjustly frozen, he or she can take legal recourse through the appropriate channels. As 2018 approaches, skeptics and speculators are concerned about investors jumping into ripple believing it to be the “next bitcoin.” People are leery because the company holding more than half the currency’s reserves and the centralized XRP freezing features can theoretically censor anyone’s transactions including the entire network. Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts are not the biggest fans of ripple and believe that because it’s not a blockchain, it shouldn’t even be represented on Coinmarketcap. However within the thick of ‘ripple haters,’ markets are doing extremely well, and investors don’t seem to be worried about the XRP ecosystem’s flaws.

2017-12-31 12:30:14,Ripple,bitcoin,This Week in Bitcoin: The Bitcoin Fork Tsunami Gives Way to a Ripple,"              $BCH               $BTC Traditionally, nothing happens in the period between Christmas and New Year. It’s a lull devoid of anything newsworthy whatsoever. Except in the world of bitcoin. Miners never stop mining and exchanges never stop exchanging because bitcoin never sleeps – and it certainly doesn’t call in a week-long vacation just cos it’s the holidays. As a consequence, neither did we. While other media sites posted pre-written reviews of the year, we delivered the freshest news as it broke this week in bitcoin. Also read: Trump’s New Tax Bill Means Changes Ahead for U.S. Bitcoiners When dawn broke on January 1st, 2017, there was no inkling of the momentous and historic year that bitcoin was about to embark on. It wasn’t until March that things started getting real crazy, and that breakneck pace was maintained for the remainder of the year. In these final moments of 2017, bitcoin has decided to go out as it came in: quietly and without much fanfare. Prices have been in something of a slump for a few weeks now, leaving the mainstream media with little to get themselves worked up over.  That doesn’t mean that 2017 has ended with a whimper though. Hell naw. Away from price considerations, a lot has happened this week in bitcoin, from new tax legislation to the arrival of a pesky centralized coin determined to launch one final attempt at The Flippening before the year is done. We’ll dispatch ripple back to the bank vaults whence it came shortly, but let’s start with the rest of the week’s news. What has more value – a whole bitcoin or a big bag of alts? The answer surely lies in the former, but with most new entrants to the cryptocurrency markets priced out of owning one whole BTC, cheap alts are catching the eye of investors. The long-term value of these coins is debatable and indeed dubious, but for now at least they’re enjoying a bounce – sometimes an extremely big bounce in the case of this month’s winners, as we reported. Some of those winners rapidly lost their new price points as quickly as they’d been acquired, it should be noted, but that’s what happens when you panic buy altcoins that have been shilled by McAfee. Live and learn. One of the more intriguing stories to emerge this week was that some cryptocurrency exchanges have been closing their doors to new customers. Bitcoin’s so hot right now there’s no more room at the inn. It’s common to embark on retrospectives as the year draws to a close, but this week in bitcoin we traveled back 20 years to revisit a book called The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg. We wrote: Freeing money means freeing people. They explain, “Each transaction will involve the transfer of encrypted multi-hundred-digit prime number sequences…the new digital gold standard or its barter equivalents will be almost impossible to counterfeit…All receipts will be verifiably unique,” which is so exactly spot-on it can take a reader’s breath. Thursday was all about forks, and the growing weariness towards these hastily contrived and often badly thought out bitcoin spin-offs. Bitcoin diamond, bitcoin god, and Segwit2x have all been given the thumbs down by the cryptocurrency community, though bitcoin private, a relaunched Zclassic, looks more interesting. Eric Wall had a lot to say about it in his weekly trading column. Speaking of trading, this week’s most popular post was Seven Deadly Trading Mistakes Every Rookie Makes. Be honest: you’ve committed at least one of these, even if it hurts too much to talk about it. As the weekend drew in, we published a thought-provoking piece on the difficulties of cashing out from crypto to fiat. Seems you might have to wait a while to get your hands on that high performance sports car your Telegram trading buddies have all been touting. Friday’s other essential read was on amendments to the US tax bill, which will compel cryptocurrency holders to tread carefully from now on – if they weren’t already.  2017 was all about bitcoin, except for those occasional weeks when it wasn’t. Remember when ethereum started getting ideas above its station, back in spring? Or how about that time when bitcoin cash looked set to land its own flippening in early November? The last of this year’s challenges to bitcoin came from litecoin…or at least so we thought. Then, out of nowhere, ripple – the great sleeper of the cryptocurrency markets – went on a mazy run, culminating in it usurping ethereum to claim second spot this week. You had a lot to say about ripple’s insurgency in the comments section, and like many here at news.Bitcoin.com were less than enamored with this centralized currency with its insane pre-mine. Five-figure bitcoin doesn’t seem that crazy, all things considered, but $2 ripple? Now that’s a head-turner. We’ve no wish to sign off on the ultimate review of 2017 by speaking of inferior cryptocurrencies, so let’s return to where we started: by toasting what has been a remarkable year for bitcoin. With the crypto community and the world at large now fully aware that decentralized currencies are here to stay, 2018 is shaping up to be the most eagerly anticipated year since the birth of bitcoin. Whatever it holds, we’ll be there to report on the latest drama, scaling solutions, and privacy developments as they unfold. Have a great New Year and we’ll see you on the other side for more of the same.

2018-01-01 11:30:12,Ripple,bitcoin,After Ripple’s Rise BTC Dominance Falls Below 40%,"              $BCH               $BTC Despite being one of the most amazing periods of sustained gains for bitcoin, 2017 ends with the first cryptocurrency losing market share to altcoins. After falling as low as 37.9% in the last two days of 2017, the market dominance of bitcoin now stands at just 38.2% as of this writing on the first day of 2018. Also Read: First Real Bitcoin Lightning Network Payment Completed via Bitrefill Bitcoin’s current total market capitalization is more than $234 billion, an incredible figure by itself but one that falls in comparison to the grand ecosystem it has birthed. The original cryptocurrency is currently comprising approximately less than 40% of the $615 billion cryptocurrency markets. This is only the second time ever that the dominance of BTC has fallen below this low threshold, the first time being in June of 2017.  Bitcoin has been gaining ground since its June low recently, reaching over 60% market share by early November. The end of 2017 however brought an onslaught of raising contenders to upset BTC’s dominance. Ripple’s XRP is now worth about $88 billion by itself after a massive rally in December. Ethereum’s market cap follows very closely now at over $74 billion. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is also not too far behind with an overall market value of $43 billion. Contributing to the market share loss of bitcoin, there are now 33 altcoins and ICO tokens that are worth over $1 billion by market cap each. These start with ripple, ether and bitcoin cash, but reach all the way down the list to dogecoin. Incredibly, there are now also about 129 altcoins and ICO tokens that are worth between $100 million to $1 billion by market cap each. With a total 1,374 coins now comprising the over $600 billion crypto ecosystem, it should perhaps be no surprise that the long tail of the market is becoming ever fatter today and weighing down its head. Looking at it this way, this development might not be a bad thing for bitcoin but rather a sign of maturity by the market. Unless of course you think most altcoins and ICO tokens are scams anyway.

2018-01-03 07:55:53,Ripple,bitcoin,Rising Ripple Threatens to Usurp Bitcoin and Usher In “The Rippening”,"              $BCH               $BTC First came ethereum, which threatened to unseat bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency in an event dubbed The Flippening. Then came bitcoin cash, which lay a glove on bitcoin core in The Cashening. Now, a revitalized ripple (XRP) is eyeing bitcoin’s top spot. Could the centralized cryptocurrency usurp bitcoin’s market cap, heralding The Rippening? Also read: Is the Centralized Ripple Database With the Biggest Pre-Mine Really a Bitcoin Competitor? Scarcely a month passes when an alternative cryptocurrency doesn’t make huge inroads on bitcoin’s dominance. Percentage gains are easy – any coin outside of the top five can realistically double or triple in price within a week. Overtaking bitcoin’s market capitalization however is significantly harder, and while ETH and BCH have both given it their best shot, they’ve yet to achieve that feat.  Despite bitcoin making gains of 14% in the last 24 hours off the back of news on Peter Thiel’s involvement, XRP has outperformed BTC, recording gains of 16%. Ripple at the time of writing had a market cap of $104 billion versus bitcoin’s $245 billion. In other words, ripple is worth 40% of bitcoin’s valuation. Each XRP token is currently trading at around $2.70. If XRP were to reach $6.75 while BTC stood still, it would overtake bitcoin to become the world’s most valuable crypto asset.  It is much easier for a sub-$10 coin to double in value than it is for one costing well into five figures. On December 29, ripple soared from $1.52 to a high of $2.50. If another similar ripple run were to occur, it could send XRP above bitcoin in the space of a week. One ripple will never achieve parity with one bitcoin, as there are a lot of ripples out there – around 39 billion as it stands. Put them all together and, priced at $6.75 a coin, you would be looking at the new cryptocurrency market leader. The psychological effect of bitcoin being toppled, for the first time in cryptocurrency history, would be huge. It would be the equivalent of a rival search engine overtaking Google. The mainstream media would have a field day and the crypto community would be up in arms, but beyond that, not much would change. Bitcoin would retain its use as a store of value, medium of exchange, and pseudonymous digital currency, and ripple would retain its use as, well…what is ripple’s use? Ripple was designed as a SWIFT alternative, providing banks with a means to send funds across borders quickly and at low cost. Like many assets, however, it is primarily used as a speculative instrument. It is the users who determine how an asset is purposed, but it is the markets that set the price – and right now the markets are buying a whole lot of XRP. Most of the trading volume is coming from Korea, although that holds true for the majority of cryptocurrencies. Anecdotal evidence suggests there’s something about ripple that’s alluring to non-traditional cryptocurrency investors. An increasing number of women seem to be taking an interest in XRP, and mainstream coverage has been extensive, with ripple surfacing in the unlikeliest of publications including British tabloid newspapers. Investors are piling into ripple because they see it as a profitable purchase, and thus far they’ve been vindicated. But what happens when the music stops and ripple drops? Naysayers have been predicting a major correction ever since ripple approached the dollar mark, and yet the coin is showing no signs of slowing down. Many crypto newcomers know and care little of Satoshi, decentralization, full nodes, and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, but they recognize profit when they see it, and right now XRP is providing that. The question that would-be investors should be asking themselves is not who’s buying ripple now, but who bought it back in the day when it was trading for cents. The answer to that question includes a number of crypto billionaires. Cofounder and former CEO Chris Larsen owns 5.19 billion XRP, around 13% of the total circulating supply. Forbes reports that this makes ripple’s executive chairman the 15th richest man in America. Current ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also holds a significant number of ripple tokens, with Forbes calculating his net worth to be at least $9.5 billion. Then there’s the 5.3 billion XRP cofounder Jed McCaleb owns. These are held in a fund and released on a monthly basis to prevent the former ripple boss from cashing out and crashing the market. Finally, there’s the additional 55 billion XRP that ripple holds in escrow, over and above the 38.7 billion tokens currently on the market. Add that together and you get a whole lot of ripples, with as much as 35% of the total circulating supply in the hands of just three people. Realistically, Larsen, Garlinghouse, and McCaleb aren’t about to offload 20 billion ripples onto the market. It is not in Larsen’s or Garlinghouse’s interests to do so, while McCaleb, who now runs Stellar (and owns one billion XLM) is unable to do so. There are evident risks inherent to investing in a project whose market price is hostage to a handful of whales. But there are also other reasons why ripple is a controversial cryptocurrency that should be approached with caution. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on how ripple has the power to “freeze” funds at its discretion, and the 55 billion XRP currently on lockdown at ripple XRP are effectively the biggest pre-mine of any digital currency.  As one dissenter pithily put it: “Ripple can f– off. They’re the Intel of crypto – backdoored from the start”. Cryptocurrency maximalists, who are passionate about matters such as financial freedom and the decentralized economy, are especially skeptical of ripple. One thing ripple’s rise arguably does show is that there is an appetite for a centralized currency that isn’t beholden to community concerns. Obtaining consensus for improvements to bitcoin core is notoriously tricky; ripple on the other hand, can be modified by the company without consultation or advance warning. Ripple’s rise means little to the average bitcoiner, whose preference for decentralized financial systems will remain unwavering. The success of XRP could mean a lot to central banks, however, who are watching the token’s ascent with keen interest. How fitting if Ripple, a centralized cryptocurrency, were to prove the gateway drug to a centralized banking coin.

2018-01-04 13:55:19,Ripple,bitcoin,Ripple Gateways Can Freeze Users’ Funds at Any Time,"              $BCH               $BTC Ripple has been the talk of the town lately thanks to its rocketing value and growing market capitalization that’s making eyes at bitcoin. $1,000 of XRP bought a year ago would be worth half a million dollars today. But away from the price action, there’s an issue bugging ripple that just won’t go away. It’s been alleged for years that Ripple Labs has the power to freeze the balances of account holders. If true, it would be a major cause for concern, especially for proponents of decentralized currency. Also read: Rising Ripple Threatens to Usurp Bitcoin and Usher In “The Rippening” The origins of the Ripple freeze go as follows: In August 2014, Ripple quietly introduced a feature called Freeze. It was put to the test a few months later when Ripple cofounder Jed McCaleb tried to cash out some of his billions in XRP after leaving the company. He’d previously signed an agreement to sell no more than $10,000 of XRP a week, only to attempt to clear $1 million worth through Bitstamp in one go. Upon learning of McCaleb’s actions, Ripple intervened and prevented him from doing so, utilizing its Balance Freeze feature. Built into Ripple gateways such as Bitstamp by default, it enables the company to stop the movement of XRP. During the brouhaha that followed, Bitstamp, caught in the middle, filed a lawsuit to settle the dispute between McCaleb and Ripple Labs. 2015 was a lifetime ago in cryptocurrency, and a lot has happened since then to all of the players caught up in the spat, and to the industry as a whole. Bitstamp, Ripple, and McCaleb would all aver that they’ve moved on to bigger and better things: the former reporting record turnover and trading volume, and McCaleb launching Stellar, whose market cap has quadrupled in a matter of days, catapulting it into the top 10. And then there’s Ripple, which is going great guns. Ripple’s transformation from sluggish cryptocurrency into the hottest ticket in town has been rapid: three months ago, no one wanted to know. Now, traders of all genders, demographics, and territories are invested in ripple, and not just financially, but emotionally too. Anyone who buys an unfancied coin and then watches it moon can’t help but feel a sense of vindication, and a newfound appreciation for the project. At this stage, anything that threatens the coin’s upward trajectory – such as negative news – risks being shot down.  In a report on ripple’s meteoric rise this week, news.Bitcoin.com mentioned the “big freeze”, linking to another recent article on the site which explains this in more detail. Ripple’s defenders hotly dispute the facts of the matter, though, highlighting a sentence on Ripple’s Freeze page which states: “No one can freeze XRP”. So what’s the truth of the matter? Can Ripple freeze users’ funds or not? The answer to Ripple’s capabilities lies in a document the company released in 2014 introducing Balance Freeze and stating: The freeze protocol extension gives gateways the ability to…freeze funds issued to a particular user. Frozen funds may only be sent back to the gateway who issued them. The global freeze feature allows a gateway to freeze all balances issued by it. When you purchase cryptocurrency on an exchange, your account is assigned a virtual balance – a token essentially – correlating to your holdings. Buy 1 BTC, for example, and nothing moves on the blockchain. All that happens is that your USD and BTC account balances are updated. It’s only once a user makes a withdrawal request that an on-chain transaction takes place. Ripple uses a distributed ledger called the Ripple protocol which each Ripple gateway – essentially a bank – keeps a record of. Bitstamp, Gatehub, and The Rock Trading are some of the major gateways partnered with Ripple. Purchase ripple on Bitstamp, for example, and the transaction won’t show up on the Ripple protocol. The ledger will only record the movement of funds when they are withdrawn from the Bitstamp wallet to the customer’s XRP wallet.  The phrase “No one can freeze XRP” is thus a half-truth. Ripple does not possess the power to magically remove the funds from a customer’s personal XRP wallet. For example, it can’t plunder the funds that a holder has stored on their Nano S. If those funds are stored with a Ripple gateway that hasn’t opted out of Freeze, however, they can be locked up. Not only can the XRP be frozen, but so can the account balances associated with its sale, such as USD. Ripple’s defenders claim that in this respect, ripple is no different from any other cryptocurrency. If Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin had 10,000 ETH stolen from him and sent to Bitstamp, for example, he could probably pressure the exchange into freezing that ether while the matter was investigated. The difference with Ripple is that the company has developed a special relationship with its gateways which gives these “banks” unprecedented powers to freeze individual counts on a whim, or on the say-so of Ripple, law enforcement, or regulators. Not only does Ripple encourage the XRP of suspicious accounts to be frozen, but “The financial institution should also freeze the counterparty in any other systems the financial institution operates that are connected to the XRP Ledger”. Your bitcoin; your litecoin; your euros; anything connected to a Ripple gateway can be locked down. No other cryptocurrency has a similar framework in place, which grants exchanges unprecedented powers to lock up funds at the drop of a hat. No one is suggesting that Ripple Labs has a desire to freeze anyone’s funds. That’s not good for business. Nevertheless, a cryptocurrency which enables a centralized authority to freeze funds at the touch of a button defeats the entire purpose of cryptocurrency. Most people have no objection to stemming the funding of terrorists and money launderers. Once a kill switch is created, however, it leads to a slippery slope in which anyone suspected of misbehavior can have their funds seized. As Ripple explains, the feature provides the ability “to freeze individual accounts issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity”. Owning XRP in a country that is hostile to cryptocurrency; possessing an unusually large amount of XRP; signing up to a Ripple gateway exchange from a banned country: all could be grounds for freezing your account. If law enforcement suspected a cryptocurrency holder was engaged in criminal behavior, they could try to obtain a subpoena granting permission to seize that individual’s exchange balance – and would be required to submit evidence to show there was probable cause for doing so. But if that exchange happened to be a Ripple gateway, they could simply pick up the phone and ask for the Big Button of Freeze to be pressed. And that’s the difference between ripple and other cryptocurrencies.  Keeping so much as 1 XRP on a gateway exchange would technically be enough to see all of your fiat and crypto balances frozen. There are ways to obtain and transact XRP without going near a gateway that possesses special powers. In a world of decentralized cryptocurrencies, however, purveyors of financial freedom may prefer to look elsewhere.

2018-01-05 12:36:31,Ripple,bitcoin,Ripple Dips After Coinbase Rejects Rumors of Adding New Assets,"              $BCH               $BTC Ripple has taken a hit by a move to end rumors that Bitcoin’s centralized competitor might be introduced to the leading trading platforms in the US. No decision to add new assets to either GDAX or Coinbase has been made, the exchange said in a blog post dismissing any statements to the contrary. Ripple lost some $30 billion of market capitalization on the day of the announcement.  Also read: Rising Ripple Threatens to Usurp Bitcoin and Usher In “The Rippening” The clarification on the matter came in response to unverified rumors and unfounded reports that Coinbase might add Ripple to its cryptocurrency markets. They have most certainly helped fuel Ripple’s surge that doubled its price in a week. After Coinbase stated it had no intentions to change its Digital Asset Framework in the short run, Ripple wobbled in charts and lost 20 percent of its value before it rebounded a little. Its capitalization is now below $125 billion, down from Thursday’s peak at almost $149 billion. One XRP coin is currently trading for less than $3.25 USD at the time of publishing according to Coinmarketcap.  Coinbase is the biggest cryptocurrency marketplace in the US and operates the Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), a platform for trading a variety of digital assets, and a broker processing crypto-fiat transactions. It trades Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and has added Bitcoin Cash support last month. BCH jumped 70% after the latest update of its Digital Asset Framework. The December 17 announcement had been proceeded by a leak that attracted a lot of criticism and led to an internal investigation. Yesterday Coinbase made it clear that it had no immediate plans to start trading Ripple, although XRP was not explicitly mentioned in its blog post: We have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company. Coinbase also reminded that its Digital Asset Framework, released a few months ago, highlights the criteria for supporting new assets. It added that a committee of internal experts was responsible for determining whether and when new assets would be added and insisted that these employees were subject to confidentiality and trading restrictions.  Ripple’s rise made it the second most valued cryptocurrency after Bitcoin during a spell when BTC saw its market share falling below 40%. XRP was trading for as little as $0.006 in January and ended 2017 at a price of $2.30 USD. A few days ago the current and former CEOs of the company, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, were ranking among the wealthiest Americans according to Forbes. Larsen, cofounder and Executive Chairman, who reportedly has the largest stash of ripples, would have placed somewhere between Steve Ballmer and Mark Zuckerberg in the 400 richest people list on Monday. But there have been some ups and downs since then – Ether passed the $1,000 barrier and Bitcoin is touching $16,000 again. In the volatile world of digital money, following experts’ advice and staring at charts doesn’t always help to find a way to sustainable growth and lasting wealth. Reading the Holy Scripture, however, may bring some peace of mind and a sense of intrinsic value: “Naked came I…, naked shall I depart!

2018-01-06 16:36:32,Ripple,bitcoin,Trading Tip `The Wall´ – Did Ripple Almost Dethrone Bitcoin “Using This One Simple Trick”?,"              $BCH               $BTC 2017 was the year cryptocurrency speculation went mainstream, which is something many bitcoiners have been yearning to happen for years. But going mainstream means that the market is no longer dominated by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and until Wall Street steps in, we’re simply going to have to accept that mainstream speculators with little knowledge of cryptocurrencies are in charge of the market. Also read: Absurd Profits from Zclassic a.k.a. Bitcoin Private If you’re a cryptocurrency old-timer, things that annoy you will become popular for reasons that seem unimaginably stupid. If you were a musician in 2012 and competing for the #1 spot on YouTube, it didn’t matter if you were the best singer in the world if your competition was “Oppa Gangnam Style”. In the same way, it won’t matter if your cryptocurrency is the most sophisticated and decentralized in the world, if the market doesn’t value those characteristics. 
 To explain what I mean, I’ve analyzed the percentage gains of each of the top 27 coins by market cap since 2017. One thing that is clear to me is that the cryptocurrency characteristic the market favored more than anything else in 2017 was not so much decentralization, technological soundness or real world usage, but rather the dollar digit bracket the coin belonged to; in this case, sub-cent unit prices.  Of course, the unit price of a coin is a totally senseless basis for making investment choices on. Any cryptocurrency–even Bitcoin–could have been a sub-cent item, if Satoshi chose the final cap to be 21 quadrillion instead of 21 million. In that case, the unit price of a bitcoin (price per each whole bitcoin) would be $0.00001697 right now instead of $16,790 but the total market cap would still have been $284 billion. Everything would be the same, except that everyone would have a million times more bitcoin–and the unit price would be cheaper. Since bitcoins (as well as many other cryptocurrencies) are divisible down to 10^8 satoshis (smaller units), it doesn’t really matter what the supply is, as long as there’s enough “particles” of the currency to go around for the economic use cases imagined to function properly. The number itself is not important. But it does directly effect the unit prices, which apparently has an enormous impact of the investment choices of mainstream investors. As stupid as it may seem, I contend that apart from what’s outlined in this great summary, the perceived “cheapness” of Ripple’s XRP (100 billion supply) is one of the reasons why it overtook Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency in the world by implied market cap this week. Ripple $XRP last night overtook Bitcoin $BTC as the largest cryptocurrency by fully diluted market cap. Further to my tweet a few weeks ago – I'd be very cautious in the space. #dashfortrash pic.twitter.com/qbIorRfMES — Leon Warburton (@Leon_Warburton) January 4, 2018  The reason why we look at market caps when we compare coins is because that’s how we compare the values of a cryptocurrency as a whole rather than just looking at the unit prices, which we know, as illustrated before, to be completely arbitrary and therefore not a good measure of anything. To visualize this is in the clearest way possible, we can normalize the supply for different altcoins to see what the prices really would look like if they all had the same supply. This is how they would compare (as of 5 Jan 2017): Another interesting aspect to look at is how many units of each altcoin you need to hold to own the equivalent of 1 bitcoin of that coin:  In these tables, I’m using the “fully diluted market cap” (max supply) as a basis for the normalization. The currencies for which the max supply is unknown such as Ethereum, I’ve used the Y2050 estimations given by Onchainfx(*). The calculation I’ve used for the  normalization table is as follows: Altcoin price x Altcoin max cap / 21M And the bitcoin equivalent altcoin holding amounts: Altcoin max cap / 21M I recommend always doing this when trying to gauge the relative value of a coin to bitcoin for long-term investments. In my opinion, it’s better than looking at unit prices or market caps based on circulating supply, because it’s the only way to correctly assess the actual valuation you’re giving a coin when buying. I think the easiest way to understand what I mean is by looking at Zcash as an example. Zcash’s supply when all coins are mined will be the same as bitcoin, 21 million, but currently, there’s only ~3 million mined (circulating supply). As such, when you’re looking at sites like Coinmarketcap, it will tell you that Zcash has a market cap of just $1.7 billion. That’s just 0.6% of bitcoins market cap and places Zcash far down the list, at #27 where it looks small and leaves much room for growth.  But the price of Zcash is $589 which is actually 3.5% of bitcoin’s $16,790. If you’re buying with bitcoin, that means you have to pay 0.035 bitcoin to buy Zcash. Another thing you have to factor in when buying Zcash at $589 is that in order for Zcash to actually keep that price over time, Zcash must amass a market cap of $12bn, climbing to what’s currently the 12th spot on Coinmarketcap. And even if Zcash were to somehow do that, you would still only break even on your investment–because you bought it at a price ($589) that implied a valuation of $12bn. That’s the reason why the Onchainfx site is listing the coins the way they are–because it tells us what the implied valuation are for coins when bought at current prices. Unfortunately, using the slightly deceitful metric “circulating supply” seems to be the norm when comparing valuations in the crypto-space. In a recent example, the Twitter-user @boxmining shared a tweet where he showed a similar supply-normalized valuation as mine but based off of circulating supply: Removing Unit Bias. If everything had the same supply cap as Bitcoin, would you still buy it? pic.twitter.com/0xrDiytPzR — boxmining (@boxmining) January 5, 2018  With this tweet he got the key message across – at the time, the implied valuation of XRP valued it above bitcoin. But if we look carefully, we’ll see Zcash at #28 on that list, with the deceitful price tag of $105, implying that the relative price of Zcash to Bitcoin is 0.6%, when as we know in reality, you have to pay 0.035 bitcoins (3.5% for a Zcash). The point I want to make is that you can get far in your ambitions to become a more informed trader than most people in the market just by using common sense and a calculator. But being able to properly compare coin valuations doesn’t matter if nobody else is doing it — at least not in the short term. It can take a long time before the market fundamentals eventually force these prices to sort themselves out. And until they do, I recommend you do your diligence to make sure you’re on the right side of that correction. (*) For Qtum, Onchainfx estimates the Y2050 supply to be 100 billion, which is erroneous. Speaking to one of the Qtum developers, David Jaenson, I confirmed this number to instead be 107822406.25.

2018-01-21 06:00:29,Ripple,bitcoin,The Rise and Fall of Ripple is a Case Study in Mass Hysteria,"              $BCH               $BTC Through late 2017 and early 2018, ripple was the darling of cryptocurrency. Mainstream media couldn’t get enough of it, South Koreans couldn’t get enough of it, and nor could crypto newcomers, who had XRP top of their shopping list. Crypto moves at a blistering pace, though, and ripple’s decline has been as rapid as its rise. Now the dust has settled and the hype dissipated, a retrospective reveals the mass hysteria behind the rise and fall of ripple. Also read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrency Prices Rebound But Uncertainty Still Lingers In the Middle Ages, a group of nuns in a French convent began randomly mewing like cats. In 1518, the Dancing Plague in Strasbourg caused people to keel over from exhaustion after gyrating for days. In 1962, a laughter epidemic broke out in a girls’ boarding school in Tanzania. And in late 2017, the world became convinced that ripple was a valuable commodity. As ripple’s market capitalization surged, there was even talk of it overtaking bitcoin to become the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. Looking through the timeline reveals the sequence of events that contributed to the rise and fall of XRP. Up until two months ago, ripple was the great sleeper of cryptocurrency. Due to the vast number of XRP in existence, its huge market cap meant it was a constant presence in the cryptocurrency top 10. Traders hated it though, dubbing it Cripple, while decentralization purists had more ideological reasons for disliking XRP, arguing that it wasn’t even a cryptocurrency.  After briefly surging in May, ripple entered into a lengthy slump. Between August and December 2017, XRP traded at between 16 and 26 cents, while other altcoins were recording exponential gains. It seemed that ripple’s time would never come. But then, on December 9, XRP began to climb. Between December 9 and 16, ripple grows from 24 cents to 88 cents, gaining 366% in a week. 12/13: Forbes asks “Is XRP The Next Crypto Rocket ‘To The Moon’?  From December 17-22, ripple rises from 76 cents to $1.19, growing another 160% in under a week. The coin is now up 500% in a fortnight. 12/17: Oracle Times writes “3 Reasons Why Amazon Will Choose Ripple (XRP) in 2018” 12/22: Bloomberg writes “Bitcoin Is So 2017 as Ripple Soars at Year End”  Ripple finishes the year with another huge leap, going from $1.19 on December 23 to $2.24 on December 29, gaining 188%.  12/30: News.bitcoin.com asks “Is the Centralized Ripple Database With the Biggest Pre-Mine Really a Bitcoin Competitor? Ripple starts the year with another run, going from a low of $1.93 on December 31 to an all-time high of $3.86 on January 4.  01/02: In a soon to be notorious feature, CNBC educates its readers on “How to buy ripple, one of the hottest bitcoin competitors”. On the same day, Forbes’ Laura Shin points out that two of Ripple’s founders are now billionaires, with Chris Larsen the 15th richest man in America. Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence stacks up suggesting that office workers, moms, manual laborers, and many others with no previous knowledge or interest in cryptocurrency are asking about ripple. 01/03: News.Bitcoin.com notes how ripple’s market cap is now 40% that of bitcoin’s, raising the possibility of “The Rippening”. 01/04: As ripple hits its all time high, news.Bitcoin.com explains that Ripple Gateways Can Freeze Users’ Funds at Any Time. Ripple’s chief cryptographer David Schwartz rages hard and pens a Quora rebuttal in which he notes that “Ripple is not a gateway and only gateways can freeze.” So exactly what the article title said then. On the same day, NYT’s Nathaniel Popper writes a Ripple feature that’s widely perceived as negative, quoting Ari Paul as saying “I’m not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP’s valuation”. Popper finishes “even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple’s software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices.” 01/05: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse lashes out at Popper on Twitter:  Over the next four days, ripple dips slightly, but by January 8 is still sitting at $3.36, up 1,400% in a month.  01/05: Coinbase rejects rumors that it is planning to add new assets, scorching the prospect of XRP being listed. 01/07: British newspapers are now heavily shilling ripple, with the Express describing it as “the exciting new cryptocurrency that has sparked interest from crypto investors”. In another piece filed the same day, it asks “Is it better to invest in XRP than Bitcoin?” 01/08: News.Bitcoin.com describes ripple as vaporware, noting “Ripple claims to have signed up over 100 banks, but the trouble is none of them seem to be using XRP tokens for money transfer”. Ripple supporters are not amused.   Over the course of the next week, ripple begins to drop and then keeps on dropping, reaching a low of 89 cents on January 16 as the entire crypto market takes a tumble. It is now down 430% from its peak 12 days earlier and is no longer the second largest cryptocurrency.  01/10: Three days after touting ripple as a bitcoin competitor, the Express writes: “Why is XRP falling so fast? What’s happening to Ripple?” 01/11: News that Ripple has signed an agreement with a money transfer service causes XRP to climb 20% before sliding again as it becomes apparent that Moneygram are only testing ripple in a single location. 01/16: Forbes documents the decline of ripple, quoting one analyst as saying: “You couldn’t turn on your TV last week and not hear about XRP or its CEO…Once Coinbase said they weren’t adding any new assets the pullback started. Now everyone is continuing to take profits.” One commenter tweets “That CNBC pump is gonna be stock footage in every documentary they make about 2018 for the next 50 years.”  As the crypto markets start to recover, ripple claws back some of its losses, reaching $1.43 on January 21. It is still up almost 600% from the start of December, but is down approx. 60% from its peak. “Early adopters” who bought XRP a month ago are in profit, but the masses who bought in at peak mania are heavily in the red. The mainstream media stop writing about ripple, and housewives shelve plans to put their savings into “the next bitcoin”. 01/18: Financial Times writes how it “spoke to 16 banks and financial services companies publicly linked to Ripple. Most had not yet gone beyond testing…none of the banks who spoke to the FT had used XRP.”  Where ripple goes next remains to be seen, though the Classic Stages of a Bubble chart has some firm suggestions:  The reality may prove more prosaic: ripple is unlikely to disappear from trace, but nor is it likely to trouble bitcoin’s market cap, which is now 3.5x greater than that of the centralized pretender which, for three heady days in January 2018, looked like it might actually be capable of achieving The Rippening. If Ripple can finally persuade a major bank to use XRP, and not just for test purposes, it could see another surge. Right now though, the heady days of $3+ ripple seem like a lifetime ago.  Ripple isn’t the first asset to be shilled to the moon and back, and it certainly won’t be the last. When the cryptocurrency history books are written, ripple will go down as a textbook case of mass hysteria, right up there with the dancing plague and the laughter epidemic.

2018-01-23 14:02:02,Ripple,bitcoin,"Church in Zürich Accepts Donations in Bitcoin, BCH, Ether, Ripple and Stellar","              $BCH               $BTC While some mainstream media sources will have you believe that bitcoin is only used for buying illicit drugs, contracting hitmen and laundering money, the truth is that it is being used for so much more than that – just like fiat currency. The latest example is a religious body that now allows members to donate using cryptocurrency. Also Read: U.S. Rating Agency to Issue Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Grades Wednesday ICF Zurich, an evangelical church from the largest city in Switzerland, has begun accepting voluntary offerings from its parishioners using cryptocurrency. According to its website, the church accepts donations directly via bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), ripple (XRP) and stellar lumen (XLM). “Digital currencies and the blockchain technology will change our daily lives more and more in the next years,” the spokesperson of the church, Nicolas Legler, told Swiss news agency Idea. “Cryptocurrencies will be implemented, be it Bitcoin or other currencies controlled by the State. We are convinced that this technology will soon belong to our daily lives. Twenty years ago, no one would have believed that internet would determine our lives so much,” he added. According to an evangelical European news portal, this church is known for its use of all kinds of new technologies in its worship services and has many young members, some of which “are increasingly using this way of doing financial transfers.” This explains the choice of accepting cryptocurrency now, as the invention has taken a strong hold on early adopters in Switzerland, as it can help the church appear innovative and relevant to them. We should also note that this is just another example of how young people are changing the donations practice. A couple of notable other examples include Pineapple Fund, the $86 million bitcoin charity which contributed towards developing MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, scalable healthcare in Nepal, combating elephant poachers, testing universal basic income in Africa, and much more; as well as Paxful’s #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative to help fund 100 schools in developing countries.

2018-02-07 11:00:19,Ripple,bitcoin,New Research Suggests Ripple Is Even More Centralized Than Previously Thought,"              $BCH               $BTC Despite being associated with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, ripple’s status as a decentralized currency is a matter of dispute. Critics have taken aim at XRP for years, claiming that Ripple exerts an unprecedented degree of control over transactions, something the company has always denied. A new report from Bitmex Research, whose cryptocurrency analysis carries great weight, suggests that ripple may be even more centralized than previously thought. Also read: The Rise and Fall of Ripple is a Case Study in Mass Hysteria The Bitmex blog, operated by the exchange famed for its 100x leverage, isn’t like other blogs. Instead of being ephemeral and newsy, it’s characterized by deep and thoughtful research that is unlike anything else within the crypto space. When a new blog post is published, the community takes notice. On Monday, the latest Bitmex Research post, “The Ripple story”, arrived. Written more like an academic paper than a blog, it delves into the origins and backstory to Ripple in forensic detail. While the entire report will be of interest to anyone trying to gauge what to make of Ripple, it is the section regarding centralization that has provoked the most interest. In January, news.Bitcoin.com reported on Ripple Gateways’ ability to freeze users’ funds, something the company’s chief cryptographer David Schwartz bitterly protested. The Bitmex blog post explores this allegation at length, explaining: In 2015, Ripple took advantage of the Ripple freeze feature instituted in August 2014. The Bitstamp gateway froze funds belonging to a family member of Jed McCaleb. Some consider this ironic: Ripple originally stated that the freeze feature was implemented to enable gateways to comply with orders from law enforcement yet the first actual usage of the feature appears to have been an order to comply with an instruction from the Ripple company itself, against one of the founders. This information was already in the public domain thanks to to court documents, as was the news that the first 32,000 block headers from the Ripple ledger are missing, making it impossible to fully audit the company all the way back to when 100 billion XRP were created. 2013 is a long time ago in cryptocurrency history, and a lot has happened since then, both to Ripple and to the industry in general. Bitmex does a meticulous job of tracking the ups, downs and labyrinthine goings on at Ripple HQ – or Ripple Labs as the company was known at one stage in its history. The most explosive part of the Bitmex blog regards the extent to which Ripple is centralized, and here the report’s author digs up new information that had not previously been documented: “In January 2018, the BitMEX Research team installed and ran a copy of Rippled for the purpose of this report. The node operated by downloading a list of five public keys from the server v1.ripple.com…All five keys are assigned to Ripple.com. The software indicates that four of the five keys are required to support a proposal in order for it to be accepted.” Since the keys were all downloaded from the Ripple.com server, Ripple is essentially in complete control of moving the ledger forward, so one could say that the system is centralised. Indeed, our node indicates that the keys expire on 1 February 2018 (just a few days after the screenshot), implying the software will need to visit Ripple.com’s server again to download a new set of keys. As the report acknowledges, there are many benefits to centralized systems from a performance perspective, however “some Ripple marketing, like the image below, contends that the Ripple system is distributed, which some may consider misleading”. There are two sides to every story of course, and Ripple’s passionate chief cryptographer wasted no time in seeking to clarify a few points that were raised in the report. The Bitmex blog concludes by saying “The real mystery about Ripple is that, given the large market value of the system, why are all the Bitcoin critics so silent?” This claim is debatable, for numerous high profile Twitter commenters and major publications, including this one, have repeatedly sought to shed light on Ripple’s token model, freeze feature, and degree of centralization. It may be more accurate to conclude that bitcoiners are well aware of Ripple and have elected to give the company and its coin a wide berth for the reasons outlined above.  Newcomers, who comprise the bulk of the crypto community these days, either don’t know or more likely don’t care about principles such as decentralization or the fact that the company controls the bulk of all XRP in existence. Regardless of one’s stance on Ripple and its XRP currency, the Bitmex report sheds welcome light on a company whose beginnings and operations are shrouded in mystery.

2018-04-11 05:30:53,Ripple,bitcoin,Is Ripple About to Become Another Ethereum?,"              $BCH               $BTC For only the second time in its history, an attempt at tokenizing Ripple’s XRP ledger through an initial coin offering (ICO) is being seriously offered by a group not formally associated with the company. It’s an interesting juxtaposition for a project widely believed to be actively separating itself from the messiness of the cryptocurrency world. ICOs are an unintended use case, it turns out, for the legacy banking establishment’s favorite new settlement tech, and, if it proves successful, could push the XRP ledger into Ethereum territory.   Also read: India Searches for Ethereum Over Bitcoin “XRP Ledger is open-source and a decentralized platform,” a Ripple spokesperson is reported to have commented, “so people can build whatever they want, but Ripple isn’t interested in promoting or supporting ICOs on the ledger.” The dismissive statement comes from the news that a Brazilian group of earnest XRP fans have launched Allvor, an ambitious ICO built on top of the tech, much in the way similar proposals happen on purpose with Ethereum. ERC20 endeavours, however, come with considerable baggage, as less than honorable projects are associated with it. And in an increasingly competitive crowdfunding environment, entrepreneurs in this space are searching for inventive ways to present the idea. Ripple has long been associated with traditional banking concerns, and boasts about that fact. It’s safe to assume an ICO touting even a loose association with the third largest crypto by market cap, and darling of the status quo, might be able to attract a pretty penny. Allvor bills itself as “the first cryptocurrency issued in the XRP Ledger with a focus on e-commerce,” writes Cleyton Domingues, co-founder and Public Policy and Management Officer in Brazil’s Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development. Mr. Domingues, along with associates Syval Peres and Leandro Gonçalves, insists “integrating the XRP Ledger’s superior technology with systems and protocols used in e-commerce as a way to boost the cryptocurrency use on a global scale,” breathlessly describing XRP as “the best and most efficient distributed database technology ever made.”   Complicating matters for Allvor are many-fold: for an ecommerce solution to work, it must have infrastructure, not just a claim to transaction speed, and that takes money; ALV, then, will be the token to help that process along. Furthermore, the project is bootstrapped which inevitably means an airdrop, which by the nature of the XRP Ledger means users must essentially agree to the project in order to receive and use ALV. And that bit is actually a selling point for Mr. Domingues, who believes such a feature allows for a kind of user control unheard of using Ethereum, for example.  At least one XRP enthusiast is voicing intense skepticism at the prospect of Allvor. “The total amount of ALV to be created equals to the total amount of XRP in existence,” a commenter wrote, “However Allvor has allocated only 5% for the initial release. Theoretically all XRP holders could apply for the Airdrop, so what happens in this case, 95% of them will be left out?”  There is also the issue of “telling a third anonymous party how much XRP you hold and what is/are your account(s). If you don’t use a proxy, you will reveal to Allvor your IP address too, because you will have to use their app to register, see their whitepaper. Maybe you will reveal even more, so far we don’t know what will the registration exactly look like,” the commenter worried.  To that end, XRP is having a heck of a time trying to get listed on exchanges. Notoriously, reports have it Ripple attempted to sweeten a potential exchange addition by offering gobs of money. No takers. This creates an interesting problem for those who might wish to alter their ALV position, attempting to cash out. And this isn’t the first time a Ripple ICO has been tried. Summer of last year, Jon Holmquist launched an ill-fated project, only to be squashed two days later by way of US Securities and Exchange concerns. In answer, he stepped back completely, writing “I will not be participating in the auction at all. I will not put in a bid for any of the PRX tokens. I think I am legally barred from doing so in the U.S. under auctioneering laws.”

2018-04-11 05:30:53,Ripple,bitcoin,Centralized Ripple Is Probably a Security Token,"              $BCH               $BTC A primary attraction of decentralized cryptocurrencies is that they’re censorship-resistant. The more centralized a coin is, the easier it is for its supply to be controlled. But there’s another problem with overly-centralized cryptocurrencies such as ripple: they risk being classified as a security, which brings all kinds of problems. Also read: Emin Gün Sirer Discusses Cryptocurrency Academics and Proof-of-Stake Ripple has long been criticized for its centralization. These concerns have revolved around the degree to which Ripple, or its partner exchanges – aka Ripple Gateways – have the power to freeze and reverse transactions. Ripple’s greatest centralization problem may owe less to the way its nodes operate, however, and more to the amount of coins held by the company. Given that Ripple owns the majority of all XRP, the argument goes, anyone buying the coin is essentially buying shares in the company. Many cryptocurrencies are the product of an incorporated company, but these companies don’t generally hold the bulk of the supply. For months, Ripple was regarded as a stick-on to become the next coin listed by Coinbase. But as news.Bitcoin.com recently reported, “Ripple may not qualify because Coinbase decrees it essential that “the ownership stake retained by the team is a minority stake””. This week, it emerged that Ripple had tried to buy its way onto Coinbase and GDAX, only for its $1 million sweetener to be rebuffed by the U.S. exchanges. There’s a certain irony in a centralized exchange not wanting to accept a coin because it’s too centralized.  On Thursday, Binance moved fast to delist centra after the coin’s founders were arrested and the SEC’s investigation into possible security fraud cranked up. Cryptocurrency exchanges don’t want security tokens: they’re a regulatory headache, and exchanges such as Bittrex have already delisted tokens that could be deemed securities. Following its acquisition by Circle, Poloniex is believed to be following suit.  If ripple was to be classified as a security, its sale would be subject to much more stringent regulations in the U.S., making it more akin to a stock than a cryptocurrency. 2018 has been billed by some in the crypto space as the year of the security token, but these tokens will be traded on specialist exchanges that are licensed to sell them, and to accredited investors. Cryptocurrency exchanges have enough regulatory issues to deal with as it is, what with the threat of banking facilities being withdrawn at short notice, without having to worry about the SEC breathing down their necks. Over the last couple of days, several commenters have crafted scathing critiques of ripple, averring that the cryptocurrency is swimming in security seas. “XRP is a security. Ripple Co is the issuer. Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, and other Ripple Co executives are subject to the anti-fraud laws under SEC jurisdiction,” opined Lawson Baker, adding “A supposed decentralized cryptocurrency can be a security with enough centralization.” Baker also claims to have assessed ripple using Coinbase’s own listing criteria, and found that there’s a 50% chance of the token being categorized as a security. Lawson Baker continues: “XRP is definitely not decentralized. Ripple Co creates the common enterprise. Ripple Co initially distributed all of XRP for money. This is the “investment of money” element of Howey Test. Ripple Co and founders control more than ~60% of the XRP in existence. Control is general 10% of voting power in traditional finance. Ripple Co even controls the inflation / dilution rate of XRP”. He finishes: “Security analysis is a spectrum. XRP is the blinding security white light.’” In a blogpost on April 5, Messari founder and prominent crypto voice “Twobitidiot” joined in, writing: “crypto companies tend to want things both ways. Act like a securities offerer when it’s convenient from a capital formation perspective or when you’re doling out “founders’ rewards”. Pretend you’re actually selling a currency or commodity when it becomes markedly less convenient from an investor disclosures standpoint.” He then went on to ask a series of questions such as “Why does the company write about XRP price appreciation as if it’s a milestone? Why do they do little to tamp down speculation around XRP enterprise adoption?” No, why do they actively insinuate big news is coming by writing things like “XRP markets began to connect the dots once again?” XRP is by no means the only cryptocurrency that could be construed as a security, but it’s the most high profile, and its knockback by Coinbase has shed new light on Ripple’s business practises. If other crypto projects could spare $1 million cash and $100 million in tokens for a Coinbase listing, many would behave in exactly the same manner. As it is, only a handful of players including Ripple, with the billions of tokens at its disposal, is in a position to make such an offer. Centralized cryptocurrencies aren’t crypto and they aren’t currency either – they’re company stock. Do you think ripple qualifies as a security token? Let us know in the comments section below.

2018-03-05 20:30:08,Ripple,bitcoin,Ripple Soars Then Plunges off Coinbase Rumors – Again,"              $BCH               $BTC In times of economic uncertainty, bitcoin flourishes. In times of high fees, litecoin prospers. And in times of Coinbase rumors, ripple shines. Today was one such day. In a repeat of December, January, and every other month, XRP has been linked with Coinbase, the altcoin rose rapidly in value on March 5…only to sink once the U.S. exchange debunked those rumors. Also read: BTC Transaction Volume Reaches Two-Year Low In the movie Groundhog Day, weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, is forced to relive the same day over and over until he finally learns to get his affairs in order. Ripple fans seem to be stuck in their very own Groundhog Day, a recurring nightmare in which XRP only pumps when the Coinbase listing rumor is trotted out. For all the work Ripple have done in seeking to develop Middle Eastern partnerships and persuade banks to trial their cryptocurrency, it seems to have had little impact on price. At the mention of Coinbase, however, the coin embarks on a rapid ascent that puts other altcoins in the shade.  On March 5, XRP began one of those climbs and was soon the day’s best performer, up 15% to a peak of $1.07. Still a long way off from its January peak of $3.64, admittedly, but a solid start nonetheless, and enough to give ripplets hope that their chosen coin was undergoing a long-overdue revival. A Coinbase listing was coming, the word on the web went, and ripple was as good as confirmed. And then, cruelly, Coinbase broke its silence to state that it had no plans to add new altcoins any time soon. While it didn’t mention XRP specifically, the implication was clear: “We have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company.” Ripple fans must feel like Brian Armstrong and co are taunting them. When will the dominant U.S. exchange finally add ripple and put an end to this eternal Groundhog Day? Not anytime soon, by the looks of it. Spreading rumors of a Coinbase listing – all it takes is a photoshopped API purporting to show the ticker – has become one of the easiest pumps to perpetrate. The strange thing is that due to its already high liquidity, a Coinbase listing is likely to apply only a temporary bump in price. Thereafter, normal service will be resumed. Ripple bagholders may be overstating the importance of such a development, should it materialize. Coinbase did make one new listing today at least, announcing Linkedin exec Emilie Choi has joined as VP of Corporate and Business Development.

2018-02-19 05:30:17,Ripple,bitcoin,PR: World’s 1st Ethereum Funding Token Meets Forbes “Ripple Effect” Criteria for Tripled Profits,"              $BCH               $BTC This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material. Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release. New York, NY Forbes recommends looking for cryptocurrency trading for less than a dollar. They believe that’s important because “smaller numbers can more easily double and triple than larger numbers can.” Ripple is a perfect example. A $1,000 investment in January 2017 would have ballooned to over $609,523 in just 12 months. Another cryptocurrency that has this “Ripple effect” is the Ethereum Funding Token, or EFT for short. As an endowment, this EFT is the World’s 1st collectible solo crowdfunding Ethereum token. The EFT is provided in exchange for donating to someone in need. This ICO represents goodwill support for contributors to exchange EFTs on various exchanges. Bonus tokens will be provided until June 30th.  The campaign serves the same purpose as receiving contributions via personal crowdfunding websites. However, they normally don’t accept cryptocurrencies, nor do they give tokens in exchange for contributions. Conveniently, the EFT does both. Although participants can hold or trade EFTs for profit, the token guarantees something more valuable than money…pride of ownership. According to the token’s creator, “The Ethereum Funding Token is a badge of honor that says, ‘Hey world, I care about the less fortunate. I gave to a stranger in need’.”  EFTs are ERC-20 compliant and can be bought, sold, traded, and exchanged the same as other Ethereum coins. There is a limited number of tokens, which is part of its appeal. The strategy creates a higher demand greater than that which is supplied, to help raise EFT’s initial price. The creator’s vision is for Ethereum Funding Tokens to become a collectible as the world’s first solo crowdfunding token given for personal hardships. The minimum contribution is .10 ETH in exchange for 1,000 EFTs. This makes the ICO one of the most affordable Ethereum contributions on the planet. Early supporters receive a generous 100% bonus during February’s pre-launch.  The EFT campaign is 100% transparent in that there is no product, no service, no team, no investors, no whitelist, and no SEC regulatory compliance issue. What the ambitious project does have is someone in need seeking aid via the Ethereum blockchain. Just as personal crowdfunding websites became the preferred method for contributing a decade ago, this new platform may become just as popular. Undoubtedly, it is a rewarding feeling to help a stranger in need. Doing so with an Ethereum token has now made it profitable as well.  The Ethereum Funding Token campaign is the World’s first solo crowdfunding project offering Ethereum tokens in exchange for contributing to a stranger in need.
