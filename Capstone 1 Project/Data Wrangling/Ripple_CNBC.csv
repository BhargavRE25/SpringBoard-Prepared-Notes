2018-01-08 06:50:00,Ripple,cnbc,Ripple will be bigger than bitcoin if it hits $7,"Market capitalization has become an obsession with many cryptocurrency watchers. It refers to the value of the entire digital currency in circulation and is worked out by multiplying the supply of the virtual coin by the price per unit. With bitcoin, the largest cyrptocurrency by market cap, having a quiet start to the year, many investors are looking at alternative cryptocoins. Ethereum and ripple, for example, have seen fairly strong rallies to begin the year. And many are wondering which one could usurp bitcoin as the biggest cryptocurrency. Ethereum and ripple have been jostling for the second spot, and that has changed depending on price.  That jostling turned volatile on Monday as the price of ripple tumbled. Bitcoin also fell, while ethereum gained in value. Ripple's current circulation is 38,739,144,847 digital coins. At Monday's earlier price of $2.49, its market cap was $96.46 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Bitcoin's market cap, meanwhile, was $254.2 billion on Monday. For ripple to surpass this, the cryptocurrency would only need to get to $6.57. This would require a rise of 164 percent. It rose nearly 36,000 percent last year. Ethereum has a circulating supply of 96,846,982. Its current price is $1,119, according to CoinMarketCap. Its market cap is $108.3 billion. Ether would need to rise to around $2,700 to surpass bitcoin's value. This would require a 134 percent rally from Monday morning's price, which is smaller than the rise required by ripple. Both these cryptocurrencies benefit from having larger circulating supplies than bitcoin. It means the price of each digital coin can be lower to achieve a higher market cap. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million with the current supply standing at 16,789,425. With bitcoin's dominance standing at record lows, and alternative cryptocurrencies seeing big price leaps, it's not inconceivable that either ether or ripple could claim the top spot in terms of market cap soon. Of course, if bitcoin sees a surge in price this year, it will make it harder for either cryptocurrency to surpass it. Still, some experts have suggested that ripple has run ahead of itself. Ripple works with large institutions and unlike bitcoin, many of the coins are actually owned by the company. This means it's not as decentralized as bitcoin is.   Playing Share this video...

2018-01-08 10:10:00,Ripple,cnbc,"Cryptocurrencies are falling, led by ripple, bitcoin","Digital currencies fell broadly on Monday, with ripple and bitcoin leading the charge lower. Ripple traded 10 percent lower at $2.46 on the Bitstamp exchange. Coinmarketcap.com showed its price down nearly 25 percent, but it appeared that may be due to the site excluding certain prices from Korean exchanges.   Bitcoin was off by 7.6 percent, while litecoin fell 6.4 percent according to Coinbase. Bitcoin futures also fell 10.5 percent at the Cboe, trading at $15,010 as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.  Ethereum prices, however, traded 4.7 percent higher at $1,143.56. Ripple left counterparts like bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market cap, in the dust last year. In 2017, ripple soared 35,000 percent, while bitcoin rose 1,500 percent. Contrary to many digital currencies, ripple has been working with large institutions, giving it an aura of legitimacy and practicality. However, cryptocurrency enthusiasts say centralization is the exact opposite of what the technology of the digital currencies should be about. ""The reason ripple is surging so much is it's a bubble,"" said Erik Voorhees, CEO of digital asset exchange ShapeShift and a vocal advocate for bitcoin as a way to separate money and the state. ""Testing crypto with banks doesn't make sense. The whole idea of crypto is you don't need banks.""

Bitcoin briefly dropped more than 10 percent before finishing the day down about 2 percent. Litecoin also fell Monday.

2018-01-09 16:20:00,Ripple,cnbc,"Bill Miller says he's started a separate bitcoin fund, believes ripple run has gone too far","Investor Bill Miller said he has split most of his fund's bitcoin holdings into a separate fund. The founder of Miller Value Partners said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that the fund had moved 90 percent of its bitcoin holdings to a separate fund, with the main fund retaining a 10 percent weighting in bitcoin and its offshoot, bitcoin cash. This is after the cryptocurrency's meteoric rise in value last year. CNBC reported in December that Miller said half the value of his fund was in bitcoin. He said they began buying bitcoin in 2014 or 2015, at an average cost of about $350. Bitcoin is currently trading near $14,935, according to CryptocurrencyMarket.com. Moving it to a separate fund allows investors to decide whether they want to continue to hold or sell it, he told CNBC. Digital currencies have grabbed a lot of attention from investors because of their quick and steep gains in the last few months. A coin created by the start-up Ripple dropped 10 percent earlier Tuesday after soaring 35,000 percent last year. Miller told CNBC on Tuesday that the rally in ripple, which is currently trading around $2.18, was ""way overdone."" But the interest in new digital coins hasn't gone away. Also on Tuesday, Kodak, a 130-year-old company, announced it will roll out its own digital currency as part of a new photography royalty tracking product.

2018-01-16 14:29:00,Ripple,cnbc,Ripple is sitting on close to $80 billion and could cash out hundreds of millions per month — but it isn't,"Sixteen months ago, Ripple raised $55 million by selling equity in a typical Silicon Valley funding round from strategic investors, following earlier financing from Alphabet's GV (Google Ventures), Andreessen Horowitz and others. The round placed the value of the company around  $400 million. Today the San Francisco start-up could bring in many times that amount of cash every month -- if it wanted to -- without giving up any company ownership or control.  Ripple develops software that banks use for fast global financial settlements. But almost all of its current value comes from being the creator and majority holder of XRP, a digital currency that was obscure a year ago, but now has a total market value of about $130 billion.  XRP, which trades publicly like bitcoin, went on an inexplicable rally starting last year. Even after plummeting from a high of $3.84 in early January to $1.30 (including a 30 percent drop on Tuesday), it's still up almost 200-fold in the past 12 months.  Ripple owns about 60 billion of the 100 billion XRP created, giving it a market value -- based just on its holdings -- of close to $80 billion. The company's revenue is unknown, although CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC that some banks are paying the company millions of dollars for its software. Regardless, $80 billion is far ahead of where any reasonable investor would value the company. Ripple has placed limitations on how much XRP it can sell each month to remove the concern that it will suddenly flood the market with tokens. The company placed 55 billion of its XRP in a ""cryptographically-secured"" escrow account and can release up to 1 billion every month. Ripple has never come close to selling that amount in a month and said in December that it's averaged selling 300 million XRP a month since mid-2016. By selling a tiny fraction of its holdings each month, the company brought in over $90 million in the first three quarters of 2017.  Ripple hasn't released its fourth-quarter XRP report yet, but if it continued selling the same amount programmatically, as a percentage of overall XRP traded, it would have raised more than $75 million in the fourth quarter and another $150 million just in the first half of January. That doesn't include money made from direct sales.  The company can dial back how much XRP it puts on the market, so there's no reason to expect that it's reeling in hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. But just having that ability puts Ripple in a cash position that's extremely rare -- particularly for a start-up with just 170 employees -- and gives it the flexibility to quickly bring in money for a pricey acquisition, fund an ambitious new project or invest in other start-ups.  Ripple executives just invested some of their XRP as part of a $25 million funding round in a storage start-up called Omni. ""In all likelihood, they need cash less than any other company on the planet,"" said Timothy Enneking, managing director of Crypto Asset Management, a crypto hedge fund in San Diego with about $70 million in assets.  Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners invested in Ripple in 2013, before the currency had any value and when the company was focused on consumer peer-to-peer payments. He doesn't have a board seat and isn't close to the company, but is suddenly looking at a potentially very valuable stake.  Figuring out exactly how to value that stake is no easy task: Lightspeed owns illiquid shares in a private company, whose soaring paper value is derived from a highly volatile asset that it plans to monetize in small chunks over the course of many years. ""It's absolutely unprecedented,"" said Liew, who's best known for his early bet on Snap. ""It hadn't been material until the end of last quarter, so now we have to think it through."" Seagate, through an investment in Ripple in 2016, could own a stake worth close to $8 billion, according to a report last week from Deep Value Research. The stock has rallied 20 percent since the report on Jan. 8, even though the company has said nothing about it publicly. While Ripple's ability to practically print money puts it in an admirable place, the start-up has attracted plenty of controversy in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that has to be mined to enter circulation and was created by a mysterious and still unidentified person using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  The Ripple payment system, by contrast, is the creation of a single company that owns the majority of XRP and has control over when it hits the market.  Critics on Reddit and elsewhere comment on how crazy it is that Ripple just created a currency ""out of thin air."" Additionally, the currency is hardly being used, making it even more difficult to justify the price surge. Ripple's core product, xCurrent, is used by banks as a messaging solution that allows them to settle cross-border payments quickly. But they're not using XRP for that. A newer and still nascent Ripple product called xRapid allows financial institutions to convert fiat currencies to XRP quickly and cheaply, and transact digitally in real time.  Last week Ripple made its first significant customer announcement for xRapid. It said that MoneyGram will use the technology and XRP to speed up and reduce the cost of transferring money. Viamericas, a money transmitter focused on sending money to Latin America and Asia, said that that it's testing XRP. Ripple claims an average transaction on its network takes between two and three seconds to process. Bitcoin transactions take around 51 minutes on average, according to data by industry website Blockchain.info. ""Bitcoin showed us what's possible, but it's not going to solve every use case,"" said Garlinghouse, Ripple's CEO, who personally owns billions of dollars worth of combined Ripple equity and XRP at the current price. ""I'm personally long bitcoin, because I think it solves a problem around the store of value."" In other words, Garlinghouse sees bitcoin as a form of digital gold, attracting investors looking to diversify their holdings. But XRP has a specific use and, if he's right, it will be the way that financial firms transact over blockchain.  ""We're driving velocity and demand of XRP,"" Garlinghouse said. None of that makes it any easier to grasp the value of XRP, which helps explain the wild price swings. The best explanation for its surge is the increasing global interest in cryptocurrencies and the proliferation of online exchanges that make it possible to buy, sell and hold these types of assets.  Enneking said that for his Crypto Asset Management fund he recently shorted XRP, and he's been more bullish on bitcoin and ethereum. ""I have a tough time understanding, even if a lot of banks use Ripple to move billions of dollars, why does that increase the value of XRP?"" he said. ""I don't understand what drives price formation.""  If 2017 (and 2018 so far) has taught us anything about cryptocurrency, it's that extreme volatility is the norm. XRP could crash below 10 cents just as quickly as it soared past $3 for any number of reasons, or no reason at all. With that sort of risk, it would make sense for Ripple to maximize its monthly XRP sales and pad its cash position as much as possible. But Garlinghouse gave no indication that he's pushing in that direction. ""For everything I do, I think what is in the best interest of the XRP ecosystem,"" he said.  Correction: A previous version of this story mistakenly said GV and Andreessen Horowitz participated in the 2016 round, instead of noting that they were earlier investors. It also incorrectly said Ripple created XRP currency, but it actually started the payment system.    Playing Share this video...

Bitcoin fell as low as $9,199.59 on Wednesday morning, but bounced back to $11,702.74 as of Thursday at 12:00 p.m. ET, according to CoinDesk, which tracks prices from cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex. It was up 5 percent in the last 24 hours. The red-hot digital asset also broke the $12,000 level, hitting $12,045.10 at about 10:14 a.m. Ethereum on the other hand dived below the $800 mark to a three-week low of $780.92 Wednesday, but lifted to $1,072.57 the following day. It was more than 5 percent higher in the last 24 hours. Ripple's XRP, which is also known as ripple, surged 65 percent to $1.64 a coin, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The digital currency — which is controversial among crypto enthusiasts due the firm behind it being backed by big banks — fell as low as 90 cents the previous day. Experts told CNBC earlier this week that investors had been ""spooked"" by news of regulatory crackdowns from both South Korea and China. South Korea — one of the largest markets for cryptocurrencies — has reportedly been considering the shutdown of trading through cryptocurrency exchanges. On Thursday, the country's policymakers said they were considering closing all domestic virtual currency exchanges, echoing a move last year from Chinese regulators. China, separately, is reported to be deepening its clampdown of its digital currency market. According to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, the country is planning to ban the centralized trading of digital currencies. ""Trade volumes were very noisy yesterday as the bulls and bears fought it out and some sort of calm has appeared on the markets after what has been a severe correction,"" Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency comparison site CryptoCompare, told CNBC in an email Thursday. ""New has a lot to play with this,"" Hayter said, adding, ""this market is now big and governments are sensing revenue for the coffers as well as a threat in some degrees. This will catalyze regulation where regimes who legislate severely will balkanise themselves to the industry."" Hayter said that regulation of cryptocurrencies ""will be good in the long run,"" but warned that ""unnecessary hoops and bureaucracy"" could inhibit the industry's potential. Regulators have expressed concerns over digital assets due to their extremely volatile nature and worries that they could be used for illicit activity. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, said: ""Now that the reasons for the recent sell-off are more clear to everyone and the slightly sour regulatory concerns have been priced in and the Asian premiums are evening out, traders will most likely start focusing on the technicals."" Greenspan told CNBC Tuesday that South Korean and Japanese investors often pay a premium of ""20 percent or more per coin."" Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk, said that the sell-off was ""a feature of the global, liquid cryptocurrency trading environment."" ""When the price of bitcoin drops, there is a pattern of traders that move to take different positions, either in another cryptocurrency or in fiat,"" he told CNBC. ""These large drops, usually between the 25-40 percent range, generally find a bottom that is a consolidation of a previous all time high. When this bottom is found, the pattern continues with demand causing a new upward bounce.""

MoneyGram, based in Dallas, Texas, will use the XRP cryptocurrency to speed up and reduce the cost of transferring money through Ripple's payment network xRapid. XRP was seen surging on the news, and flew almost 15 percent higher to $2.22 at 9:55 a.m. ET, according to Coinmarketcap data. The move marked a recovery following downward pressure across most major cryptocurrencies Thursday after reports of South Korea preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading. Ripple claims an average transaction on its network takes between two and three seconds to process. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, take around 51 minutes on average to go through, according to data by industry website Blockchain.info.

It temporarily became the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value last month, usurping ethereum, after a huge rally. XRP declined significantly after that rally but Ripple said its price has not been reflected accurately, claiming that industry website Coinmarketcap's decision to remove Korean cryptocurrency exchanges from its platform has affected prices.

The financial technology start-up is the owner of XRP, the third most valuable cryptocurrency behind rivals bitcoin and ethereum, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Its distributed ledger network, RippleNet, has been joined by the likes of United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based lender RAKBANK and U.K.-based currency exchange firm IFX. It has also cleared a payments path into South America by signing up online payment provider dLocal. Blockchains are huge encrypted groupings of data dispersed across the globe that record information on digital currency transactions. People are able to exchange digital assets across these distributed ledgers without friction as they are not governed by intermediaries such as governments and central banks. Ripple hopes its latest round of financial customers will allow it to undermine the dominance of banks and corporations over financial transactions. ""The global payments industry really has been ruled by an oligopoly, led by players like JPMorgan and Citi,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC during a phone call Monday. He referred to criticisms leveled at cryptocurrencies like bitcoin by business leaders such as Jamie Dimon and Ray Dalio. ""It's certainly not that surprising to see Jamie Dimon's comments recently on bitcoin given that they (JPMorgan) control that oligopoly."" Dimon called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that will eventually ""blow up."" One of Ripple's new corporate customers, Mexican non-bank financial services firm Cuallix, will be the first institution to trial Ripple's cryptocurrency, the firm said Tuesday. Ripple claims its digital asset XRP is among the most liquid due its low transaction fees and instant payments. Banks and corporations are currently required to pre-fund local currency accounts around the world to be able to send payments quickly. By using Ripple's virtual currency, Cuallix will be able to lower the cost of payments from the U.S. to Mexico, Garlinghouse said. ""I think we're really at a tipping point for the blockchain industry,"" he said. The start-up already has interest from big-name clients including Santander, UniCredit, UBS and Standard Chartered.

2018-01-17 14:50:00,Ripple,cnbc,Ripple co-founder loses $44 billion on paper during cryptocurrency crash,"The digital currency plunge has wiped billions from the paper fortune of a cryptocurrency billionaire in just a few weeks. Ripple's XRP coin has fallen 74 percent from an all-time high of $3.84 hit on Jan. 4, erasing $44 billion from the holdings of Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple. With XRP trading near $1 Wednesday, Larsen now holds the equivalent of just $15.8 billion, according to CNBC calculations using figures from Forbes. Citing sources at Ripple, Forbes said earlier this month that Larsen has 5.19 billion of XRP and a 17 percent stake in the start-up. Ripple holds 61.3 billion of the 100 billion XRP coins in existence. At XRP's peak on Jan. 4, Larsen was worth $59.9 billion. That made him one of the five richest people in the U.S. and wealthier than Google's founders, based on Forbes' rich list. A Ripple spokesperson had nothing to add at the time, and did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment Wednesday.  Ripple 12-month performance  Source: CoinMarketCap Major digital currencies have plunged in the last two days after reports raised concerns about increased regulation on cryptocurrencies in South Korea and China. Last week, XRP prices also appeared to fall after CoinMarketCap said it was excluding prices from certain Korean exchanges due to significant price differences with other markets.  On Wednesday, bitcoin dropped below $10,000 on CoinDesk for the first time since late November. Ethereum was close to 18 percent lower near $865, after falling through the $1,000 level Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap. With bitcoin trading near $9,870 on Wednesday, twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss' possible holdings of the digital currency have fallen to around $904 million. The brothers had a combined worth of more than $1 billion in bitcoin as the digital currency surged in December. The calculations are based on a report the brothers had $11 million in bitcoin at $120 a coin in April 2013. A representative for the twins did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The brothers may have sold or bought bitcoin since April 2013. January's price rout hardly dents cryptocurrencies' massive gains in 2017. Bitcoin soared about 1,500 percent, while XRP shot up more than 35,500 percent.  The losses may have knocked Ripple's Larsen from the five wealthiest people in America. But at $15.9 billion he still beats 32nd place Rupert Murdoch, who has a net worth of $15.4 billion according to Forbes.  Playing Share this video...

2018-01-24 14:06:00,Ripple,cnbc,"Ripple sold $91.6 million of its digital currency XRP last quarter, as the price surged almost 30,000%","Ripple, the payments company that's developing a blockchain-based system for banks, sold $91.6 million worth of digital currency XRP in the fourth quarter, taking advantage of last year's 29,631 percent price surge. Trading volume in the quarter jumped more than 35,000 percent to an average of over $807 million a day from $2.28 million in the same period a year earlier, Ripple said on Wednesday. ""XRP markets ended the year with a statement — one that will likely be remembered as a defining milestone in XRP's history,"" the company said.   For Ripple, which owns about 60 percent of all the XRP in existence, the sudden excitement for cryptocurrencies and all things blockchain has been a huge boon to the start-up's balance sheet. In total, Ripple used XRP sales to bring in over $180 million last year, without having to give up any equity in the company. That gives Ripple a significant cash cushion as it tries to sell its software to financial institutions and provides some protection in case the price of XRP crashes. It's been a wild ride so far to start 2018. After starting the year at $2.30, XRP quickly shot up to a high of $3.84 on Jan. 4, before tumbling below $1.12 days later. The currency currently sits at $1.35, which translates into about $81 billion worth of holdings for Ripple. In order to control the flow of XRP into the market, Ripple put the majority of its stake — 55 billion — into an escrow account and has the flexibility to sell up to 1 billion a month. CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC, in a story published last week, that the company has no intention of maximizing its sales to pad its cash position.  In the fourth quarter, Ripple sold $71.5 million of XRP through programmatic sales and $20.1 million directly to investors. If it sold the same percentage of total volume traded through programmatic sales this quarter as last, Ripple would have already generated over $70 million through Jan. 23, using daily volume numbers tracked by CoinMarketCap. The big test for Ripple is getting financial institutions to adopt XRP so that it's more than just a highly volatile trade. Earlier this month, the company announced that MoneyGram is using Ripple's xRapid technology and XRP currency for cross-border payments. And in a separate announcement on Wednesday, the company said that IDT Corporation and Mercury FX will use xRapid ""to settle remittances and corporate transactions quickly."" The idea is to eliminate the time it takes for payments to clear using a digital currency that's built for financial transactions. Here's how Mercury FX founder Alastair Constance described it in the statement. ""Digital assets promise fast transaction speeds but XRP is far faster than all of them, including bitcoin. Cutting settlement times from hours and days to just three seconds or less will remove billions of dollars in unnecessary intermediary fees.""   Playing Share this video...

2017-05-26 05:11:00,Ripple,cnbc,Bitcoin rival Ripple is suddenly sitting on billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency,"Blockchain start-up Ripple is in a precarious position for a 5-year-old company. The business is still in its very early days but suddenly has billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. Ripple, which built a digital payments network for real-time financial transactions, is also the creator and biggest owner of Ripple XRP, a digital currency that has increased in value by 40 times this year. There's a total of 100 billion XRP in existence, each priced at about 26 cents. The $26 billion of total value is second among cryptocurrencies, behind bitcoin, which is valued at $41 billion. Ripple owns about 61 percent — or $16 billion worth — of XRP. If that were factored into the company's valuation, Ripple would be worth more than all but four U.S. start-ups — Uber, Airbnb, Palantir and WeWork. XRP is surging alongside bitcoin and ether as well as smaller digital currencies like dash and monero. They're all benefiting from the growing interest in blockchain, a distributed electronic ledger that makes all transactions trackable. Unlike other cryptocurrencies on the market, XRP is tied to — and majority-owned by — a single company. That's led to concern among XRP investors and enthusiasts that Ripple will one day decide to capitalize on its massive stake and flood the market with currency. Some venture investors would surely welcome cashing in on some of that value after pouring about $94 million into the company. But for people with thousands (or millions) of dollars wrapped up in XRP, the fear of a sudden excess of supply has been unsettling, particularly considering the volatility of the currency. The price fell 13 percent late in the day on Thursday and double-digit daily moves are normal.  To create some long-term stability and ease those concerns, Ripple announced a plan last week for the structured sale and use of its currency. By the end of 2017, the company will put 55 billion of its XRP into escrow and will unleash up to 1 billion into the market every month. Thus, investors will have some sense of what's coming. ""We decided to take the issue off the table,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in an interview. ""We wanted to make sure we were combating any uncertainty about supply."" Garlinghouse is a well-known name in Silicon Valley. He had senior executive roles at Yahoo and AOL and was CEO of Hightail (formerly YouSendIt) from 2012 to 2014. He joined Ripple in 2015, and earlier this year took over the CEO role from founder Chris Larsen, a serial entrepreneur, who previously started online lender Prosper.  Garlinghouse likened Ripple's situation to Yahoo, which derives almost all of its current value from its large stake in China's Alibaba. (Yahoo's core business is being sold to Verizon and the Alibaba stake is being spun out into a new holding company called Altaba.) The analogy only goes so far, as equity investors haven't ascribed a big multibillion dollar valuation to Ripple. The company last raised money in September, when the XRP currency was worth a tiny fraction of its current price. However, Ripple's business has picked up quite a bit of momentum since then, which helps explain at least some of XRP's rally. Last month, Ripple signed up 10 new financial institutions, including BBVA, to its payments platform that supports speedy transactions by eliminating all the friction that exists between various currencies and financial systems. Global banks including Bank of America, RBC and UBS are also customers. While bitcoin is the more established cyptocurrency, it's primarily used today as an investment vehicle and has run into big latency problems with handling transactions.  Ripple and ethereum have emerged as the early leaders in enabling business arrangements, with Ripple trying to build the digital payments standard for the financial sector. ""Some of those banks are all in and some are still in the early stage running a pilot,"" Garlinghouse said. ""We have real customers touching real production systems. We're the only company you can say that about in our space.""   Playing Share this video...

2017-11-16 08:01:00,Ripple,cnbc,"American Express, Santander team up with Ripple for cross-border payments via blockchain","American Express and Santander have partnered with financial technology firm Ripple to speed up cross-border payments between the U.S. and the U.K. by using blockchain technology. Payments made by American Express' business customers on its FX International Payments (FXIP) platform will now be routed through Ripple's enterprise blockchain network, RippleNet. Blockchain — otherwise known as distributed ledger technology — allows vast amounts of data to be stored on a dispersed network of computers around the world, rather than on one centralized server. It was originally used to record all bitcoin transactions but increasingly businesses are finding alternative uses for the technology, such as payments, trade finance and identity verification. A number of other financial institutions have been experimenting with distributed ledger projects, including JPMorgan, UBS, Credit Suisse, Barclays and HSBC. ""This collaboration with Ripple and Santander represents the next step forward on our blockchain journey, evolving the way we move money around the world,"" Marc Gordon, executive vice president and chief information officer at American Express, said in a statement Thursday.  American Express' blockchain project will initially allow customers in the U.S. to connect instant, traceable cross-border non-card payments to U.K. Santander bank accounts. ""This blockchain solution opens up a new channel between the U.S. and the U.K. and presents significant opportunity for payments globally"", Jose Luis Calderon, global head of global transaction banking at Santander, said in a statement Thursday. The distributed ledger platform will enable all parties involved to keep track of a transaction's status and cost. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that its blockchain network would allow the business customers of financial services firms to move money in ""real-time."" ""We're taking a huge step forward with American Express and Santander in solving the problems corporate customers experience with global payments. Transfers that used to take days will be completed in real-time, allowing money to move as fast as business today,"" Garlinghouse said in a statement Thursday. Both American Express and Santander suggested the blockchain project could eventually be extended worldwide. Ripple said that it is has tested a means of speeding up payments with its cryptocurrency, XRP, and that this would become a feature in its partnerships with banks and other financial companies further down the line. ""The XRP currency will come into play later on in the evolutionary dynamics and the other players,"" Marcus Treacher, global head of strategic accounts at Ripple, told CNBC in an interview. ""The technology we have developed, it separated a connection from the cryptocurrency or the token. So what that means is that a bank or non-bank like AMEX can use Ripple to connect and just exchange value from one fiat currency to another directly, without the need for any intermediate blockchain currency."" Some banking executives have raised concern about cryptocurrencies in recent weeks. Last month, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC he was ""not necessarily"" a believer in cryptocurrencies but that he saw a future for blockchain. Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam went as far as to describe the world's largest cryptocurrency bitcoin as ""the very definition of a bubble."" And, most notably, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has been particularly critical of bitcoin, and last month said that anyone ""stupid enough to buy bitcoin"" would ""pay the price for it one day.""

2017-12-22 02:54:00,Ripple,cnbc,"Bitcoin, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies slip while ripple briefly surges to third place","Alternative digital currency ripple made some significant gains Friday, despite the wider market for cryptocurrencies seeing a sharp pullback. Also known as XRP, it soared to $1.24 at 1:14 a.m. ET, and was up 25 percent over a period of 24 hours, according to data from industry website Coinmarketcap. The digital currency reached the key psychological $1 mark for the first time Thursday, and hit an all-time high of $1.38 that same day. It briefly retook its place as the third-largest cryptocurrency, with a market value of $47 billion, a milestone it reached earlier this month. Ripple pared its gains later Friday morning. Its market capitalization fell bellow that of bitcoin cash, as XRP's price slid to 95 cents by 3:25 a.m. ET. Interest in alternative cryptocurrencies — known as altcoins — tends to increase when there is too much activity congesting the blockchain network underpinning bitcoin, according to experts. But major altcoins including ethereum, bitcoin cash and litecoin were also seen trading lower Friday. Bitcoin cash was surrounded in controversy earlier this week after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase unveiled support on its service for buying and selling the bitcoin rival. Some accused the venue of insider trading with bitcoin cash trading higher hours before the service launched its new feature. Coinbase said it is currently investigating these claims, and would ""not hesitate"" to fire employees if it finds they violated its trading policy. Meanwhile, litecoin's price fell after its creator Charlie Lee said he had sold and donated all of his holdings in the cryptocurrency. Lee said his sold stake was a ""small percentage"" of daily volume on the cryptocurrency exchange GDAX and that it ""did not crash the market."" Ripple said Thursday that its digital token was now available on  more than 50 exchanges around the world. One cryptocurrency expert pointed to talk of XRP being listed on Coinbase as a potential reason for the surge in its price. ""There are rumors on social media that XRP will be the next coin to be listed on Coinbase,"" Charles Hayter, chief executive of virtual currency comparison site Crypto Compare, told CNBC in an email. ""Litecoin and bitcoin cash experienced large volumes and price pumps on the same announcements and investors are looking to pick the next one."" XRP was created by Ripple, a blockchain firm, as a means of making international payments. The virtual coin is used to exchange high-value transactions from one fiat currency to another directly, and removes the need for fees normally associated with such transactions. The firm has said XRP transactions can be settled in four seconds. As a company, Ripple is backed by a number of big international banks and other financial institutions. Financial firms use its decentralized ledger platform, RippleNet, to make fast, cross-border payments. In November, Ripple teamed up with American Express and Santander on a blockchain pilot to speed up cross-border payments between the U.K. and U.S. In a phone interview at the time, Marcus Treacher, Ripple's global head of strategic accounts, told CNBC its virtual currency would ""come into play later"" in blockchain pilots with its financial partners.

Officially called XRP, ripple climbed 55.9 percent to a record high of $2.23 Friday afternoon, according to CoinMarketCap. The digital currency had a market cap of $86.3 billion, surpassing ethereum's $73 billion, according to the website. Earlier, the two cryptocurrencies vied for the second-place spot as prices fluctuated in morning trading.  Bitcoin remains the largest digital currency by far. It has a market capitalization of roughly $247 billion, accounting for about 41 percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap tracked by CoinMarketCap. Ripple accounted for about 12.5 percent, while ethereum was around 12.1 percent, the website showed. Six largest cryptocurrencies by market cap  Source: CoinMarketCap CoinMarketCap charts show ripple had climbed above ethereum into the second-place spot in May. But back then ripple was only worth about 36 cents. The digital currency ended 2016 at less than 1 cent and topped $1 only last week, before leaping above $2 Friday afternoon. Ripple is up more than 34,700 percent this year. Ethereum rose about 2 percent to $753.57 Friday afternoon, with a market cap of about $72.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin traded slightly higher, near $14,475, according to Coinbase. Ripple is officially the name of a San Francisco-based start-up using blockchain technology to develop a payments network for banks, digital asset exchanges and other financial institutions. Network participants use a digital coin called XRP for transactions. The cryptocurrency has a four-second settlement time, versus more than two minutes for ethereum and over an hour for bitcoin, according to Ripple's website. The company said more than 100 financial institutions use its network. In the last few weeks, some South Korean and Japanese banks have been testing Ripple's systems for cross-border payments, according to the company.  The start-up owns 61 percent of the 100 billion XRP in existence. At Friday's record high prices, that gives Ripple about $136 billion worth of the digital currency.  Playing Share this video...

2018-01-02 06:55:00,Ripple,cnbc,Bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency market is at its lowest level ever,"Bitcoin's dominance of the cryptocurrency market is at its lowest level ever thanks to rising interest in alternative digital coins. On Tuesday, its market cap was $231.8 billion, or around 36.1 percent of the total value of all cryptocurrencies. This is the lowest share of the market that bitcoin has had in its history. Bitcoin's previous low was 37.6 percent in June. By contrast, at the start of 2017, its market share stood at over 80 percent. Dominance refers to the percentage a single virtual currency has of the market capitalization or value of every cryptocurrency in the world. The total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency world stood at $640.4 billion on Tuesday, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin rallied by more than 1,300 percent in 2017. In December, it hit a record high of $19,783.21 before a sharp sell-off saw it plunge, closing the year at $13,889.99, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index, which tracks prices from digital currency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex. The decline of bitcoin's dominance, which on Dec. 1 stood at around 55 percent, is due to the pullback in price, but also rising interest in other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, ripple and litecoin. On Dec. 1, for example, ripple's value stood at around 3 percent of the entire market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. On Tuesday, it was over 14 percent. Ripple's price rose over 36,000 percent in 2017 and it is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Investors appear to be taking a breather from bitcoin for now and looking at alternative cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has divided the financial and business world. Last year, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a ""fraud."" And last week, The Gartman Letter editor and publisher Dennis Gartman told CNBC that bitcoin would trade under $5,000. But many in the industry are also bullish on the cryptocurrency. Dave Chapman, managing director at cryptocurrency trading firm Octagon Strategy, sees the price of bitcoin exceeding $100,000 before the end of 2018.  Playing Share this video...

2018-01-02 16:47:00,Ripple,cnbc,"How to buy ripple, one of the hottest bitcoin competitors","If you thought bitcoin was hot, maybe you should learn about ripple. It's another crytocurrency that's been rocketing in popularity lately.  While it was trading at around $0.20 a few months ago, it's now worth more than $2.25 per coin. Ripple is a little different than many other popular cryptocurrencies because it was created by a private, for-profit company that is still the biggest individual owner of the currency. But ripple isn't as easy to buy as bitcoin or other popular cryptocurrencies, since it isn't available in popular apps such as Coinbase. That means you need to jump through a few hoops to buy it. I tried several methods and think I've come up with the easiest: Only some of ripple's recommended exchanges include support for buying Ripple with the U.S. dollar, which would be the easiest way. Unfortunately, after trying several and running into technical issues or login problems, I settled on an exchange called Bitsane. (Update: Bitsane has been experiencing server overload problems. You can also try using Binance.) Setting up an account is easy, and the main page has all sorts of information on current exchange prices for trading between various cryptocurrencies. It also lets you send and receive currency from other apps, such as Coinbase, which we'll get to in a moment. Now you'll need to buy another cryptocurrency: either bitcoin or ether (the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain). It's annoying that you need to do this extra step, but unfortunately it's the easiest way to move forward. I used Coinbase to buy ether and bitcoin. It's easy to use and you can buy it using the U.S. dollar, either through a linked bank account or debit card. Follow our guide on how to buy bitcoin and ethereum for this step. In this case, I'm buying $200 worth of ether. Next, you're going to move the ether you own in Coinbase over to the Bitsane platform so you can use it to buy ripple. I know it sounds complicated, but it isn't. Do this: Now that your ether is in your Bitsane account, you can use it to buy ripple. You can see how much ripple you now own under balances. Here we can see I ended up with about 45.88 full ripple coins. Now, since I can't really spend ripple anywhere, I can just sit on it and see what happens. As with most cryptocurrencies, you're taking a bet here on whether the value is going to increase or decrease. But unlike bitcoin, you can actually buy several of these at once without spending too much money.  Playing Share this video... Watch Next...",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/02/how-to-buy-ripple.html
2018-01-03 05:04:00,Ripple,cnbc,Ripple cryptocurrency hits a record high above $3,"Ripple, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by value, hit a record high on Wednesday as its strong rally continues. The digital coin jumped 29 percent to an all-time high of $3.20 in afternoon trading, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple, or XRP, now has a market capitalization of $122.7 billion and remains solidly in second place to bitcoin, which has a market value of about $251 billion, the website showed. Ripple 12-month performance  Source: CoinMarketCap The website showed ripple has gained more than 49,500 percent over the last 12 months, and more than 160 percent over the last week. Unlike bitcoin, Ripple is a company that has created coin known as XRP that is aimed at enterprises. Ripple markets itself as a cross-border payments solution for large financial institutions based on blockchain technology. Currently, an international payment may take a few days to complete, and at a high cost. A headache for banks is high-volume, but low-value, transactions — the kind that Facebook might pay out to app makers, for example. These can often be expensive and unprofitable for banks because it takes a lot of effort to move the money and the percentage cut won't be as high as for a larger transaction. Ripple is trying to solve this problem via its technology. XRP can be used by enterprises to get instant liquidity needed in a high-value transaction, without having to pay fees. XRP acts as a bridge between fiat currencies during a transaction. Ripple said transactions in XRP can be settled in four seconds, faster than any major cryptocurrency right now. Ripple has been conducting trials with a number of financial institutions, including American Express and Santander. Its price was also helped by news in December that Japan's SBI Holdings and SBI Ripple Asia, which was formed as a partnership between the two firms in 2016, created a consortium with Japanese credit card companies to utilize blockchain. Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, including Ripple. There is also a sense that investors are looking at alternative digital tokens beyond bitcoin.

Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple, has 5.19 billion of the company's digital coin XRP and a 17 percent stake in the company, according to Forbes, citing sources at Ripple.  With XRP hitting a high of $3.84 on Thursday, Larsen's holdings are worth about $59.9 billion. That puts the former Ripple CEO just ahead of Larry Ellison, who ranked fifth on Forbes 400 list with a worth of $58.4 billion. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ranks fourth, with a worth of $74.4 billion.  Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rank eighth and 10th on the list, respectively.  A representative for Ripple said the company had nothing to add. Its XRP coin soared 35,500 percent to $2.30 last year, far outpacing bitcoin's and ethereum's gains. The company owns 61.3 billion of the 100 billion XRP coins in existence, giving Ripple a market value of nearly $235.4 billion Thursday. The San Francisco-based start-up is using blockchain technology to develop a payments network that more than 100 financial institutions are using, according to the company. Ripple's website also says that the XRP coin has a four-second settlement time, versus more than two minutes for ethereum and over an hour for bitcoin. Cryptocurrency founders can often hold large amounts of the digital coins they create. The anonymous bitcoin founder known as ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" has 980,000 bitcoins, or about 4.7 percent of all bitcoins that will ever exist, based on widely accepted analysis by Sergio Demian Lerner.

2018-01-05 19:08:00,Ripple,cnbc,Second-largest cryptocurrency ripple may have run ahead of itself,"Digital currency ripple has blown past its cryptocurrency rivals largely because it is working with large institutions, which give it an aura of legitimacy and practicality. However, cryptocurrency enthusiasts say that centralization is the exact opposite of what the technology of the digital currencies should be about.

""But clearly the use case for XRP is quite clear. That sets it apart from other crypto assets."" When asked which firms are using XRP, a Ripple representative pointed to an October announcement that said a bank called Cuallix is the first financial institution to use XRP, in this case for U.S.-Mexico transactions. No other firms were named. Cuallix has main offices in Mexico, the U.S. and Hong Kong, according to its website. ""While it's not required for banks to use XRP, as the native digital asset to the XRP Ledger it adds further value to customers in sourcing low-cost, on-demand liquidity,"" a Ripple representative said in a statement to CNBC. Bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, is up more than 25 percent this year to about $17,000, or 1,500 percent over the last 12 months, according to Coinbase. In contrast, XRP climbed 35,000 percent to $2.30 last year and has soared nearly 67 percent since to an all-time high of $3.84 on Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap. The coin remains the second largest by market cap, but fell to trade near $3 on Friday after leading U.S. digital currency marketplace Coinbase pushed back against rumors it would launch XRP trading.  ""I think a lot of retail investors think that by investing in XRP they'll be able to own a part [of the business], but they're not a stock,"" said Dan Ciotoli, software engineer and blockchain analyst at Bespoke Invest. ""I'm kind of on the side that XRP itself is not going to be used by banks,"" Ciotoli said. However, Ripple said in a tweet Thursday that 3 of the top 5 global money transfer companies plan to use XRP in payment flows in 2018. Like many of the alternatives to bitcoin that have emerged, XRP offers far faster speeds than bitcoin, which was the first application of blockchain technology when it launched nine years ago. Bitcoin transactions takes at least an hour to settle, ethereum more than 2 minutes and XRP about 4 seconds, according to Ripple's website.  All that is faster than traditional systems, which can take days. But there are fintech start-ups such as TransferWise that already allow consumers to send money overseas more quickly and cheaply than most traditional means. In a November report, Bernstein Senior Research Analyst Lisa D. Ellis said a test found using bitcoin to send money overseas was nearly 10 times more expensive than using TransferWise and also slightly slower.  CNBC reported, however, that bitcoin did prove useful for big-ticket items such as school tuition when both the buyer and seller held the digital currency.  ""One of the things we all have to remember is the value of a token over the long term is really going to be driven by its utility,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on Dec. 27 on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" ""There's no question there's a lot of hype in this system."" XRP isn't quite there yet in terms of actual usage, but then again, neither is bitcoin.  Playing Share this video...
